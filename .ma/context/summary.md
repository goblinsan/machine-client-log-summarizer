### 📏 File Analysis

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|-------|
| `src/main.tsx` | 173 | 7 | Entry point; likely initializes app logic and renders root component. |
| `src/styles.css` | 170 | 11 | Stylesheet with basic styling (likely global resets or UI layout). |
| `src/App.tsx` | 74 | 3 | Main React component; may render the log viewer UI. |

> ⚠️ **No files exceed 200 lines** — all are under 180 bytes in size.  
> ❌ No large or complex components, services, or utilities observed.

---

### 🔍 Size & Line Hotspots

- **Largest by size**: `src/styles.css` (170 bytes) → likely contains most styling logic.
- **Longest by lines**: `src/styles.css` (11 lines) → suggests concise, declarative CSS.
- All files are short and simple — consistent with a minimal MVP UI.

> 📌 **Conclusion**: This project is not feature-rich. It appears to be a basic React app scaffolded for local log ingestion display, possibly used as a starting point before adding backend logic or data processing.

---

### 🔮 Files Likely to Be Touched Next (Rationale)

1. **`src/main.tsx`**  
   → Entry point; likely needs updates to integrate with logging service or UI state management.  
   → May require routing, context setup, or integration with log ingestion API.

2. **`src/App.tsx`**  
   → Core component for rendering logs; next step could be adding a log viewer (e.g., list, table, or stream).  
   → Might need event handling or state to manage incoming log data.

3. **New File: `src/log-parser.ts` or `src/LogViewer.tsx`**  
   → Not observed in scan — but logically needed for MVP functionality.  
   → Likely next addition to support parsing and displaying logs.

> ⚠️ **No Alembic migrations detected** — no database migration files found in the scan.  
> ✅ This is a frontend-only project, likely not using a backend DB or ORM.

### 🚩 What Was Not Observed

- ❌ No `.ts` or `.tsx` files beyond those listed  
- ❌ No `components/`, `utils/`, `services/`, or `types/` directories  
- ❌ No test files (e.g., `*.test.tsx`)  
- ❌ No backend code, API endpoints, or server logic  
- ❌ No database schema or migration files (Alembic not detected)  
- ❌ No package.json, tsconfig.json, or build scripts observed  
- ❌ No file sizes above 200 bytes — all are under 180 bytes  

> 📝 **Note**: The scan shows only 3 files totaling ~417 bytes and 21 lines of code. This is a highly minimal project structure.

---

### ✅ Summary

This project is a **minimal React frontend** for an MVP focused on local log ingestion and UI display.  
It has no backend, database, or complex logic — just three core files to render and style the interface.

Next steps likely involve:
- Adding log parsing logic
- Building a dynamic log viewer component
- Connecting to a mock or real log source

No migration files found → **no database changes tracked**.

> 🚀 Project is at early stage; ready for feature expansion in UI and data flow.
