### File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| `src/App.tsx` | 6,642 | 211 | Primary UI component. Likely contains logic for file picker and log summarization pipeline. Central to the task of "adding a file picker and local ingestion pipeline". |
| `src/styles.css` | 1,756 | 114 | Global CSS styles for the app (layout, colors, fonts). Not directly involved in functionality but essential for UI presentation. |
| `src/main.tsx` | 123 | 5 | Entry point of the application (likely bootstraps React app). Minimal content — suggests a simple or boilerplate setup. |

### Size & Line Hotspots

- **Largest File**:  
  - `src/App.tsx`: **6,642 bytes** (≈ 6.6 KB)  
    - **Lines**: 211 → Most lines in the project  
    - **Observation**: This is the dominant file by both size and line count. It likely contains:
      - File input handling (file picker)
      - Local ingestion logic (e.g., reading logs, parsing, summarizing)
      - UI rendering of log summaries
    - Directly aligns with the task: *"Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline"*

- **Second Largest**:  
  - `src/styles.css`: 1,756 bytes  
    - Contains styling for components (likely form inputs, containers, etc.)

- **Smallest**:  
  - `src/main.tsx`: 123 bytes → likely just renders `<App />`

---

### Files Likely to Be Modified Next

✅ **`src/App.tsx`**  
- **Rationale**: This is the only file with significant code volume and directly supports both:
  - File picker integration (e.g., input field, drag-and-drop)
  - Local ingestion pipeline logic (reading files, parsing logs, processing data)
- The task description explicitly requires these features — this file is the logical focal point.

⚠️ **`src/styles.css`**  
- May need updates to support new UI elements (e.g., file picker button, upload zone) as part of the design refinement.  
- Not a primary focus for logic but may be touched during UI iteration.

❌ **`src/main.tsx`**  
- Minimal content and not expected to change significantly — likely remains unchanged unless restructuring entry points.

---

### Alembic Migration Summary (if applicable)

🔍 **Not observed in scan summary**  
→ No Alembic files, migration directories, or database-related files were detected.  
→ This project appears to be a frontend-only application focused on UI and file processing, not backend services with persistent data storage.

> ✅ Conclusion: **No migrations are present or referenced** — no need for migration tracking or versioning in this context.

---

### Final Notes

- The project is small (3 files, 8.5 KB total) and appears to be a React-based frontend for local log ingestion.
- All functionality tied to the task ("Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline") is expected to be implemented within `src/App.tsx`.
- No backend services, databases, or configuration files were observed — this is a pure client-side application.

✅ **Next Step Recommendation**:  
Begin editing `src/App.tsx` to:
1. Implement a file input component (e.g., `<input type="file">`, drag-and-drop)
2. Add logic to read and process the selected log file locally
3. Display summary output or status in UI

This aligns directly with the task's goal and is supported by the project structure observed.
