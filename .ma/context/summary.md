## 🔍 File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| **src/styles.css** | 75,742 | 3832 | Primary styling file. Likely contains global CSS for UI components. High line count suggests extensive styles (e.g., responsive layouts, theme variables). |
| **src/App.tsx** | 1970 | 78 | Main React component. Likely renders the application UI — possibly includes a log viewer or file picker interface. |
| **src/main.tsx** | 202 | 9 | Entry point for the app (likely bootstraps React). Minimal content, indicating a simple app structure. |

> ⚠️ **No observable components related to file selection, ingestion pipelines, or streaming log reading** in the codebase.  
> The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" is **not yet implemented**, which aligns with its status: `not_started`.

## 📈 Size & Line Hotspots

| File | Bytes | Lines | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| `src/styles.css` | 75,742 | 3832 | **Largest file**, dominates project size. Suggests heavy UI styling (possibly tailwind or custom CSS). High line count may indicate maintenance burden if not modularized. |
| `src/App.tsx` | 1970 | 78 | Medium-sized, likely contains core rendering logic. Could be expanded to include file picker and log ingestion flow. |

> 🔍 **No files exceed 200 lines** — all are under 2k bytes in size.  
> The project is lightweight in terms of code volume but has a significant CSS footprint.

## 🚀 Files Likely to Be Modified Next (Rationale)

1. **`src/App.tsx`**  
   - ✅ **Primary target for task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline"**  
   - Reason: This is the main React component where UI logic (like a file input or button) would be integrated. It's the only file with sufficient space to add new components or state management.

2. **`src/styles.css`**  
   - ⚠️ May need updates if styling changes are required for file picker, log viewer, or scrollable list.  
   - Reason: If a new UI element (e.g., drag-and-drop zone) is added, it may require responsive layout adjustments.

> ❌ **No migration files observed** — no Alembic or version control migration structure detected.  
> ❌ No Python scripts, backend logic, or ingestion pipelines found in the scan.  
> ⚠️ The project appears to be a frontend-only UI (React + CSS), with **no backend processing or file parsing logic** currently present.

---

## 📝 Summary & Implications

- ✅ Project structure is minimal and focused on frontend rendering.
- ❌ No existing code for:
  - File picker
  - Local log ingestion pipeline
  - Streaming reader (tail-like behavior)
  - Log parsing or display in JSON blocks
- 🔧 **Next step**: Implement `file picker` in `App.tsx`, then add logic to read and process local files (e.g., `.log`) via a simple file reader or `fs` module (if backend is added later).
- ⚠️ Current scan does not show any backend or data processing layer — this may require new files (e.g. `ingestion.ts`, `file-reader.ts`) to be created.

---

## Final Note

> **The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" is valid and necessary**, but **no existing codebase support for such features was observed** in the scan.  
> This indicates a clean slate — ideal for starting development from scratch, with `App.tsx` as the primary entry point.

✅ **Recommended action**: Begin by modifying `src/App.tsx` to include:
- A file input or button
- A log viewer area (scrollable list)
- Placeholder logic to simulate ingestion (e.g., read a sample log file)

➡️ This aligns with the MVP goal and leverages existing structure.  

> 🚫 **No migration files, no backend code, no file processing logic observed** — all are absent from this scan.  
> If future work requires data parsing or streaming, new files must be added explicitly.
