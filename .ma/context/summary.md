### 📄 File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| `src/App.tsx` | 443 bytes | 20 lines | Main React component — likely renders the UI for log summarization. |
| `src/main.tsx` | 347 bytes | 15 lines | Entry point of the application (likely bootstraps React). |
| `src/styles.css` | 529 bytes | 20 lines | Global CSS styles for layout and appearance. |

> ⚠️ **No JavaScript logic, components, or state management observed** beyond these files.  
> The project is extremely minimal — possibly a prototype or MVP scaffold.

---

### 🔍 Longest & Largest Files

| Metric | File |
|-------|------|
| **Largest (by bytes)** | `src/styles.css` (529 bytes) |
| **Longest (by lines)** | `src/App.tsx` (20 lines), `src/styles.css` (20 lines) |

> ✅ All files are under 1 KB and less than 30 lines — consistent with a minimal, static UI.

### 🚀 Files Likely to Be Modified Next

Based on the MVP goal ("Local ingestion + UI"):

1. **`src/App.tsx`**  
   - *Rationale*: This is the primary component where UI logic and log display would be implemented. It's likely the first file to expand with state, input handling, or rendering of logs.

2. **`src/main.tsx`**  
   - *Rationale*: May need updates to integrate with a local log ingestion service (e.g., fetch logs from a mock API or file reader). Could be extended to handle routing or initialization.

3. **`src/styles.css`**  
   - *Rationale*: To support responsive layout, better readability of log entries, and visual feedback for loading states — essential for user experience in the UI.

> ❌ No files related to backend logic, data ingestion, file parsing, or API calls were observed — indicating that these are **not yet present**, and will likely be added next.

---

### ⚠️ Missing Components (Not Observed)

- Backend services / APIs  
- Log ingestion logic (e.g., reading from files, parsing logs)  
- State management (Redux, Context, etc.)  
- Component structure (e.g., `LogEntry`, `SummaryCard`)  
- Tests or configuration files  
- `package.json` or build scripts  
- Migration files (no Alembic detected)

> ✅ **No Alembic migrations observed** — this is not a Python-based database-driven project.  
> The codebase appears to be purely frontend-focused.

---

### 📌 Summary

This project is a **minimal React frontend** for a log summarization tool, currently in the MVP phase focused on local ingestion and UI display.  

- It has only 3 files: `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, and `styles.css`.  
- All are small and static — no complex logic or state.  
- The next steps will likely involve:
  - Adding log parsing and rendering in `App.tsx`
  - Implementing file input or API calls for local ingestion
  - Enhancing styling to support readable log output

> 🚀 **Next Action Suggestion**: Expand `src/App.tsx` with a log viewer component that reads from a local file (e.g., `.log`) and displays summary statistics.
