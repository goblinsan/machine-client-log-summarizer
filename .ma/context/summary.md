### File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| `src/App.tsx` | 6,642 | 211 | Primary UI component. Likely contains the file picker logic and ingestion pipeline flow as per task description. This is the central piece of functionality being developed. |
| `src/styles.css` | 1,756 | 114 | Global styles for the application (e.g., layout, fonts, colors). Not directly related to logic but essential for UI presentation. |
| `src/main.tsx` | 123 | 5 | Entry point of the React app — likely bootstraps the App component. Minimal in size and lines, indicating a simple setup. |

---

### Size & Line Hotspots

- **Largest File**:  
  - `src/App.tsx`: **6,642 bytes** (≈6.6 KB) — dominates file count by size.  
    → This is the only file exceeding 1 KB and has over 200 lines of code.  
    → Suggests it's a central component handling both UI and logic for local ingestion.

- **Longest File**:  
  - `src/App.tsx`: **211 lines** — exceeds all others in line count.  
    → Indicates significant complexity, likely including file input handling, state management, and ingestion pipeline setup.

> ✅ All files are under 8 KB total; no large or unstructured modules observed.

### Files Likely to Be Modified Next (Rationale)

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `src/App.tsx` | **Primary target** for the task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline". The component is both largest and most complex, making it the natural place to implement UI controls and logic. It likely needs event handlers for file selection, state updates, and integration with a backend or processing engine. |
| `src/styles.css` | May need updates to support new UI elements (e.g., drag-and-drop zones, file input styling). While not code-heavy, visual feedback is critical in user experience during ingestion. |

> ⚠️ **No other files** were observed — no `utils/`, `components/`, `services/`, or migration files present.

---

### Alembic Migration Summary (if applicable)

❌ **Not observed**:  
- No Alembic, database, or migration-related files detected in the scan.  
- The project appears to be a frontend-only application focused on UI and file ingestion logic.  
→ Migration tracking is not relevant here.

---

### Final Assessment

The current state of the project is minimal but structured:

- A React-based frontend with one main component (`App.tsx`) handling both presentation and core functionality.
- Task alignment: "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" directly maps to modifying `App.tsx` to include:
  - File input (e.g., drag-and-drop or browse button)
  - State for tracking selected files
  - Logic to trigger a local ingestion process (possibly via a service or mock processor)

> ✅ **Next Steps**:  
> Focus development efforts on enhancing `src/App.tsx` with file selection UI and ingestion pipeline logic.  
> Consider adding inline comments in the component to track ingestion flow stages.

> ❌ **Not Observed**:
> - No backend services, API endpoints, or database files.
> - No test files (e.g., `.test.ts`, `__tests__/`).
> - No configuration, environment, or build scripts.
> - No migration history or version control schema tools.
