## üîç File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| **src/styles.css** | 75,742 | 3832 | Primary styling file. Likely contains global CSS for UI components. High line count suggests extensive styles (e.g., responsive layouts, theme variables). |
| **src/App.tsx** | 1970 | 78 | Main React component. Likely renders the application UI ‚Äî possibly includes a log viewer or file picker input. Given its size and position, it's central to the MVP UI. |
| **src/main.tsx** | 202 | 9 | Entry point of the app (likely bootstraps React). Minimal content suggests simple routing or rendering setup. |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **No observable components for file picker or ingestion pipeline logic** ‚Äî these are not present in the current file structure.  
> The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" is **not yet implemented**, which aligns with the project being at 0% completion.

## üìè Size & Line Hotspots

- **Largest File**: `src/styles.css` (75,742 bytes) ‚Äî **~97% of total file size**  
  - Lines: 3832 ‚Üí **longest single file**, indicating dense CSS rules.
  - Likely a styling bottleneck if future refactoring is needed.

- **Longest File**: `src/styles.css` (3832 lines)  
  - Suggests potential for code duplication, poor modularity, or lack of component-based styling.

> ‚úÖ No file exceeds 1000 lines ‚Äî no monoliths beyond the CSS file.  
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **No files >200 lines** other than `styles.css` (which is 3832 lines).

## üöÄ Files Likely to Be Modified Next

### ‚úÖ Top Priority: `src/App.tsx`
- **Why?**  
  - This is the main UI entry point.  
  - The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" will require integration into this component.  
  - It's likely where user interaction (e.g., file selection) and log processing flow begins.

### ‚úÖ Secondary: `src/styles.css`
- **Why?**  
  - If the UI grows with collapsible JSON blocks or a log list, styling for these elements will be needed.  
  - May require responsive layout adjustments to support file picker and scrollable logs.

> ‚ùå No files related to:
> - File input handling (e.g., `FilePicker.tsx`, `FileUploader.tsx`)
> - Log parsing / ingestion logic (e.g., `ingestion.ts`, `logProcessor.ts`)
> - Streaming reader or tail-like process (not observed)
> - JSON rendering or collapsible blocks

## üö® Missing Components (Not Observed)

| Feature | Status |
|--------|--------|
| File picker UI component | ‚ùå Not present |
| Local ingestion pipeline logic | ‚ùå Not observed |
| Streaming log reader (tail-like) | ‚ùå Not in scan |
| JSON rendering with collapsible blocks | ‚ùå No such files detected |
| State management for logs or file selection | ‚ùå No state-related files found |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **The current codebase is minimal and likely a starting scaffold**. All required features for the task are absent ‚Äî this aligns with the "not started" status.

---

## üìú Alembic Migration Summary (if applicable)

‚ùå **No Alembic or migration-related files observed in scan.**  
‚Üí No database migrations, no `migrations/` directory, no `.py` migration scripts detected.

> ‚úÖ This project appears to be a frontend-only MVP with no backend or DB layer at this stage.

---

## Summary & Next Steps (Aligned with Task)

| Action | Rationale |
|-------|----------|
| **1. Add file picker UI** | Must modify `src/App.tsx` to include input for selecting local log files. Use `<input type="file">` or a component like `react-dropzone`. |
| **2. Implement ingestion pipeline** | Create new logic (e.g., in `utils/ingestion.ts`) to read file content and parse logs ‚Äî likely using Node.js streams or synchronous reading. |
| **3. Add streaming reader** | Implement tail-like behavior via `fs.createReadStream()` or `readline` for real-time log monitoring (as per task). |
| **4. Render logs in scrollable list with collapsible JSON blocks** | Requires new components (`LogItem.tsx`, `JsonBlock.tsx`) and state to manage expansion/collapse. |

> üîç **Note**: All of these are *not present* in the current scan ‚Äî they must be added as part of this task.

## Final Note

The project is at a very early stage with only 3 files observed, all focused on UI styling and entry points. The required features for "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" **are not currently implemented** and will require significant new development.  

‚úÖ **Context hydrated successfully based solely on scan data.**  
‚ùå No hidden or inferred components were assumed ‚Äî every detail is grounded in the provided summary.

‚û°Ô∏è Proceed to implement `src/App.tsx` enhancements for file selection and log ingestion pipeline.
