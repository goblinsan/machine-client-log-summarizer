### File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| `src/App.tsx` | 6,642 | 211 | Primary UI component. Likely contains file picker logic and ingestion pipeline flow. This is the central file for implementing "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" task. |
| `src/styles.css` | 1,756 | 114 | Global styles (e.g., layout, fonts, colors). May include styling for file input fields or progress indicators during ingestion. |
| `src/main.tsx` | 123 | 5 | Entry point of the application. Likely bootstraps React app and renders `<App />`. |

> ‚úÖ All files are present and directly relevant to the task.

### Files >200 Lines

- **`src/App.tsx` (211 lines)**  
  - This is the only file exceeding 200 lines.  
  - Given its size and role, it is likely responsible for:  
    - File input handling (e.g., `<input type="file">`)  
    - Logic to trigger local ingestion pipeline (e.g., reading log files, parsing, summarizing)  
    - UI state management (e.g., file selection status, processing progress)  
  - **High priority** for development ‚Äî this is where the task must be implemented.

---

### Size Hotspots

- **Largest File**: `src/App.tsx` (6.6 KB) ‚Üí Dominates project size due to combined UI and logic.
- **Second Largest**: `src/styles.css` (1.7 KB) ‚Üí Styling layer, not code-heavy but significant in total file count.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è No other files or components were observed ‚Äî the entire application is tightly packed into a single React component (`App.tsx`) with minimal entry and styling.

---

### Files Likely to Be Touched Next (Rationale)

1. **`src/App.tsx`**  
   - ‚úÖ **Primary target** for implementing file picker and ingestion pipeline.  
   - Must include:  
     - A `<input type="file" />` or drag-and-drop zone  
     - Event handler on file selection  
     - Logic to read the log file (e.g., via `FileReader`)  
     - Trigger a local processing step (e.g., parse lines, extract timestamps, summarize)  
   - This file will likely grow in size as features are added.

2. **`src/styles.css`**  
   - üîç Secondary touchpoint for UI polish.  
   - Will need styling for:  
     - File picker button/area  
     - Loading spinner during ingestion  
     - Success/error states after processing  

3. **`src/main.tsx`**  
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Minimal involvement ‚Äî likely just renders `App`.  
   - No changes expected unless restructuring entry point (not required for current task).

### Alembic / Migration Summary

‚ùå **Not observed** in scan summary.  
‚Üí No database migrations, no `.alembic/`, or migration files detected.

> This project appears to be a frontend-only application with no backend DB layer or ORM usage. Therefore, migration concerns are irrelevant here.

---

### Final Assessment

- ‚úÖ The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" is **feasible** and directly mapped to `src/App.tsx`.  
- üîß Development should begin by modifying `App.tsx` to:  
  - Add a file input  
  - Handle file selection  
  - Trigger local log parsing/summarization (if backend logic exists elsewhere, it would be out of scope here)  
- üö´ No database or migration system is present ‚Äî no Alembic files observed.  
- üìå Project structure is minimal and focused: one React app with core UI in `App.tsx`.

> **Next Step Recommendation**: Open `src/App.tsx` and implement a file picker with ingestion pipeline logic, ensuring it aligns with the MVP goal of local log processing.
