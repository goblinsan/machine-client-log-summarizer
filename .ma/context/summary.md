## File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role / Purpose |
|------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| `src/styles.css` | **75,742** | 3,832 | Primary styling file. Likely contains all CSS for the UI. Given its size and line count, it is a central component of the visual design. No JavaScript logic present. |
| `src/App.tsx` | 1,970 | 78 | Main React component likely responsible for rendering the application interface. Expected to contain routing, layout, and initial state setup. Likely where file picker and log display components will be integrated. |
| `src/main.tsx` | 202 | 9 | Entry point of the app (likely bootstraps React). Minimal content — suggests a simple or boilerplate structure. |

> ⚠️ **Note**: No files related to file system interaction, logging pipelines, streaming readers, or UI components like "file picker" were observed in the scan. This is consistent with the task being *not started*.

## Size & Line Hotspots

- ✅ **Largest File**: `src/styles.css`  
  - Bytes: 75,742 (≈ 76 KB) → **~19% of total project size**  
  - Lines: 3,832 → **~98% of total lines**  
  - Implication: The UI styling is heavily focused or complex. This may indicate a need for modularization or CSS optimization to improve maintainability.

- ✅ **Longest File**: `src/styles.css` (3,832 lines)  
  - Dominates both size and line count — suggests potential for refactoring into smaller, reusable style modules.

---

## Files Likely to Be Modified Next (Rationale)

1. **`src/App.tsx`**  
   - **Why?**: This is the central React component where UI logic lives. The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" will require integration of:
     - A file input/select element
     - Logic to read a local log file (e.g., via `FileReader`, `fs`, or `readFileSync`)
     - A streaming reader for real-time log tailing (as per the next task)
   - This component is the natural place to embed these features.

2. **`src/main.tsx`**  
   - **Why?**: While small, it may need updates to import new components or configure React context/state for file handling and log rendering.

3. *(Not observed)*: No files related to:
   - File system APIs (e.g., `fs`, `path`)
   - Streaming readers (`Stream`, `readline`, `tail`-like logic)
   - JSON parsing / pretty-printing
   - Scrollable list or collapsible blocks

> ❌ **No evidence of existing file picker, ingestion pipeline, or streaming reader code** — this aligns with the task status: *not_started*.

---

## Alembic Migration Summary (if applicable)

- ✅ **Alembic not observed in scan**  
  → No database migrations detected.  
  → This is expected for a frontend-only log summarizer project, which likely does not use a backend database.

> 🚫 **Migration count**: Not applicable — no Alembic files found.

---

## Conclusion

The current state of the project is minimal and focused on UI styling (`styles.css`) with a basic React structure. The core functionality (file picker + local ingestion pipeline) has **not been implemented**, which matches the task status: *not_started*.

### Next Steps (Aligned with Task & Scan)
1. ✅ **Modify `src/App.tsx`** to:
   - Add file input component
   - Implement event handler for file selection
   - Integrate local ingestion pipeline logic (e.g., read file, parse logs)

2. 🔍 **Add streaming reader logic** (as per next task):
   - Use Node.js `fs.createReadStream()` or similar to tail log files in real time
   - Stream lines into a React component for live rendering

3. 📝 **Refactor `src/styles.css`**:
   - Break down large CSS file into modular components (e.g., `layout.css`, `log-entry.css`)
   - Improve readability and maintainability

4. ⚠️ **No existing code found** for:
   - File picker
   - Log parsing
   - Streaming tailing
   → These must be implemented from scratch.
