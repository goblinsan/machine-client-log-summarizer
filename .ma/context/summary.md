### 📝 File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| `src/main.tsx` | 173 | 7 | Entry point of the application. Likely initializes React app or bootstraps the UI. |
| `src/App.tsx` | 74 | 3 | Main component rendering logic; likely defines the root UI structure. |
| `src/styles.css` | 170 | 11 | Global styling for the application (likely includes layout, fonts, colors). |

> ⚠️ **Note**: All files are extremely minimal — no components, no logic, no configuration observed beyond basic structure.

### 🔍 Size & Line Hotspots

- **Largest by size**:
  - `src/styles.css` → 170 bytes (largest)
  - `src/main.tsx` → 173 bytes (second largest)

- **Longest by lines**:
  - `src/styles.css` → 11 lines (longest)
  - `src/main.tsx` → 7 lines
  - `src/App.tsx` → 3 lines

> 📌 The styling file is both the largest and longest, suggesting it may contain more complex or repeated CSS rules.

---

### 🔮 Files Likely to Be Touched Next (Rationale)

1. **`src/main.tsx`**  
   ✅ *Reason*: Entry point of React app; likely where the file picker integration or ingestion pipeline logic will be implemented. The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" implies this is a core component.

2. **`src/App.tsx`**  
   ✅ *Reason*: Root UI container — will need updates to render the file picker, upload status, or ingestion progress indicators.

3. **`src/styles.css`**  
   ✅ *Reason*: May require styling for new UI elements (e.g., file input, drop zone, loading state). Given its size and line count, it's a likely candidate for visual updates.

> ❌ No other files exist in the project — no `components/`, `utils/`, `services/`, or migration files observed.

---

### ⚠️ Missing Observations (Not Observed)

- 🔍 **No component structure** (e.g., `components/FilePicker.tsx`, `services/ingestion.js`)  
- 🔍 **No backend integration, API calls, or ingestion logic**  
- 🔍 **No Alembic migration files** — no database schema changes observed  
- 🔍 **No test files**, configuration files (`tsconfig.json`, `.env`), or package.json details  
- 🔍 **No file picker implementation or local ingestion pipeline code**  
- 🔍 **No UI state management (e.g., React hooks, Redux)**  

> 🚫 These are not present in the scan — they were not observed.

### ✅ Summary

This project appears to be a minimal React frontend scaffold focused on **local file ingestion and UI rendering**, aligned with the task: *"Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline"*. However:

- The current codebase is extremely small (only 21 lines of code).
- No actual implementation of file picking or ingestion logic exists.
- No backend, state management, or component structure is visible.

➡️ **Next Steps (Recommended)**:
- Add a `FilePicker` component to `src/components/`
- Implement event handling for file selection
- Integrate local ingestion pipeline (e.g., read file → parse log → summarize)
- Update `App.tsx` to render the picker and status UI
- Style new elements in `styles.css`

> 🚨 **Warning**: The current state does not support any functionality related to file ingestion or summarization. This is a foundational setup, not an active implementation.

**Final Note**:  
The project context has been hydrated based solely on the scan summary provided. No files beyond those listed were observed — no migration history, no backend services, and no logic for ingestion or UI interaction exists in this snapshot.
