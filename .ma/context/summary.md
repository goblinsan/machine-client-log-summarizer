### 🔍 File Roles & Observations

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| `src/App.tsx` | 1119 | 42 | Primary application entry point. Likely contains UI logic, state management, and file picker integration. This is the **core component** for implementing "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" task. |
| `src/main.tsx` | 173 | 7 | Entry point for React app (likely bootstraps the application). Minimal content — suggests a simple or boilerplate setup. |
| `src/styles.css` | 170 | 11 | Global styling rules. Likely defines layout, fonts, and basic UI appearance. |

> ⚠️ **No additional files** such as `components/`, `utils/`, `services/`, `types/`, or migration scripts were observed in the scan.

---

### 📈 Size & Line Count Hotspots

- **Top file by size**:  
  - `src/App.tsx` — **1,119 bytes (83% of total)** → This is the dominant file and likely contains most of the logic for the current task.
- **Longest in lines**:  
  - `src/App.tsx` — **42 lines** → Suggests a moderately complex component, possibly including event handling or state transitions related to file selection.

> ✅ All files are small (under 1.5 KB), indicating this is a minimal prototype or early MVP stage.

---

### 🚀 Files Likely to Be Modified Next

| File | Rationale |
|------|---------|
| `src/App.tsx` | **Primary target** for the task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline". This file will likely need updates to include: a file input element, event listeners (on change), and logic to trigger local log ingestion. It is already the central component of the app. |
| `src/main.tsx` | May require minimal changes to integrate new components or state — but currently very simple; likely just needs a reference to App. |
| `src/styles.css` | Could be updated with UI improvements (e.g., file picker styling) if visual design is being refined. |

> ❌ **No migration files, no backend services, no config files, no test files** were observed — indicating this is a frontend-only MVP focused on local ingestion UI.

---

### 🚫 What Was Not Observed

- 🔍 No Alembic migrations (no database schema changes)
- 🔍 No `.gitignore`, `package.json`, or `tsconfig.json` files
- 🔍 No backend logic, API endpoints, or services
- 🔍 No test suite or unit tests
- 🔍 No component structure (e.g., `components/FilePicker.tsx`)
- 🔍 No configuration or environment variables

> ⚠️ **Note**: The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" implies a feature that would require both frontend UI and backend processing. However, **no backend or ingestion logic** was observed in the scan — this may indicate either:
> - A gap in the current codebase (missing service layer)
> - Or that the ingestion is simulated locally via client-side logic (e.g., file reading + parsing)

---

### 📝 Summary & Next Steps

- **Current state**: Minimal React frontend with a single main component (`App.tsx`) handling core UI.
- **Task alignment**: The task "Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline" can be addressed by enhancing `src/App.tsx` to:
  - Add an input field for file selection
  - Handle file upload events
  - Trigger parsing/ingestion logic (possibly in-memory or via mock processing)
- **Recommendation**:
  - Begin editing `src/App.tsx` to implement a file picker.
  - Consider adding a new component (e.g., `FilePicker`) if modularization is desired — though not observed here, it may be needed for scalability.
  - Add logging or console output in the ingestion pipeline to verify data flow.

> 🔍 **No migration files detected** → No database changes expected at this stage.  
> 🚨 **Warning**: The project appears to lack backend processing logic. If true local ingestion (e.g., parsing logs, storing results) is required, additional services or modules must be added — not present in current scan.
