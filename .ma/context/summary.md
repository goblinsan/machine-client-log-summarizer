**Project Tree Sketch**

├── src/
│   ├── App.tsx          (443 bytes, 20 lines)
│   ├── main.tsx         (347 bytes, 15 lines)

> The project structure is minimal and appears to be a basic React application with no subdirectories or additional components.

**File Roles & Observations**

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role |
|------|--------------|-------|------|
| `src/App.tsx` | 443 | 20 | Main React component rendering UI; likely the entry point for application logic and layout. |
| `src/main.tsx` | 347 | 15 | Entry file for the React app (likely bootstrapping ReactDOM, routing, or initial setup). |
| `src/styles.css` | 529 | 20 | Global CSS styles defining visual appearance of components; no complex styling observed. |

> All files are small and serve standard roles in a minimal React frontend.

---

**Size & Line Count Hotspots**

- **Largest by size**:  
  - `src/styles.css` (529 bytes) — largest file, likely due to global styles or utility classes.
- **Longest by line count**:  
  - `src/App.tsx` (20 lines) and `src/styles.css` (20 lines) — both have the longest line counts.  
    → Suggests either a simple component structure or minimal styling.

> No file exceeds 50 lines; all are concise, indicating early-stage development or a prototype.

---

**Files Likely to Touch Next**

1. **`src/App.tsx`**  
   - Rationale: As the primary React component, it is likely the first point of modification when adding new features (e.g., UI components, state logic).

2. **`src/main.tsx`**  
   - Rationale: A common entrypoint for routing, context setup, or integration with external services; may be modified to add authentication, analytics, or API calls.

3. **`src/styles.css`**  
   - Rationale: If visual changes are needed (e.g., responsive layout, theme switching), this file will be updated. However, due to its brevity, it's likely not a major styling hub.

> ⚠️ No additional files or directories were observed in the scan — no backend code, tests, config files, or migration scripts present.

---

**Alembic Migration Summary**

❌ **Not Observed**  
→ Alembic migrations were not detected in the file list.  
→ No `.py` migration files (e.g., `alembic.ini`, `versions/...`) found.  
→ No database-related structure observed.

> Conclusion: This project does not appear to use Alembic for versioned database schema changes.

---

**Final Notes**

- The project is **minimal**, likely a prototype or early-stage frontend application.
- All files are small and serve standard React roles.
- No backend, tests, or database migrations present in the scan.
- No additional components, features, or dependencies observed beyond what's listed.

✅ Context fully hydrated with no assumptions beyond the provided scan.  
❌ No Alembic migration data available — not observed.  

> Ready for next steps: feature development, UI enhancement, or integration planning.
