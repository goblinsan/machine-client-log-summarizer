- **Project ID**: `1808e304-fc52-49f6-9a42-71044b4cb4b5`  
- **Project Slug**: `1808e304-fc52-49f6-9a42-71044b4cb4b5`  
- **Milestone**: `MVP - Local ingestion + UI`  
  - Milestone ID: `mvp-local-ingestion-ui`  
  - Task Name: `Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline`  
  - Task Status: `not_started`  
  - Summary: "Ready to start"  

> 📌 **Note**: The task is currently not started, indicating the project is in early development phase.

### 🔍 File System Structure (Observed)

The repository root contains exactly **3 files**, totaling **51,175 bytes** and **2,580 lines of code**.

#### 📁 Root Directory (`.`)
- **Files**: 3  
- **Total Size**: 51,175 bytes  
- **Total Lines**: 2,580

### 🔥 Key Files & Their Characteristics

| File | Size (bytes) | Lines | Role / Purpose |
|------|--------------|-------|----------------|
| `src/styles.css` | **49,317** | **2,504** | Primary styling file. Dominates project size and line count. Likely contains global CSS for UI components. |
| `src/App.tsx` | 1,735 | 71 | Main React component. Likely renders the application entry point (e.g., file picker + ingestion UI). |
| `src/main.tsx` | 123 | 5 | Entry point for the app (likely bootstraps React or initializes the app). |

> ⚠️ **No other files, directories, or subcomponents were observed** in the scan.

### 📈 Size & Line Hotspots

- **Largest File**:  
  `src/styles.css` — **49.3 KB**, **2,504 lines**  
  → This is by far the largest file and dominates both size and line count. Suggests significant UI styling or component-specific styles.

- **Longest File (by lines)**:  
  `src/styles.css` — **2,504 lines**  
  → Indicates a large CSS file, possibly with complex media queries, responsive rules, or component-level styling.

- **Other Files**:  
  - `src/App.tsx`: 71 lines — reasonable for a React app entry point.  
  - `src/main.tsx`: 5 lines — minimal, likely just JSX/React setup (e.g., `ReactDOM.render()`).

> ❌ No file exceeds 200 lines in length except `styles.css`, which is **well over** the threshold.

---

### 🚀 Files Likely to Be Modified Next (Rationale)

Given the task:  
> "**Add file picker and local ingestion pipeline**"

The following files are most likely to be touched next:

1. ✅ `src/App.tsx`  
   - **Why**: This is the main component where UI logic (like a file picker) would be implemented. It's the central place for rendering user-facing features.

2. ✅ `src/styles.css`  
   - **Why**: A file picker UI will require styling (e.g., buttons, input fields, drag-and-drop zones). The large size suggests it’s already used for existing components — likely needs updates to support new UI elements.

3. ⚠️ `src/main.tsx`  
   - **Why**: While minimal, it may need minor changes if the ingestion pipeline logic is being integrated (e.g., importing new modules or setting up event listeners).

> 🔍 No Alembic migration files were observed in the scan → **No database migrations present**.

---

### 🚫 What Was Not Observed

- ❌ No `src/components/`, `src/utils/`, or other subdirectories  
- ❌ No `.ts` or `.tsx` files outside of `App.tsx` and `main.tsx`  
- ❌ No JavaScript, TypeScript, or React hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`) were observed in content — only structure inferred from file names.  
- ❌ No backend services, API calls, or ingestion logic was detected.  
- ❌ No migration files (Alembic or otherwise) → **No database schema changes tracked**  
- ❌ No test files (`*.test.tsx`, `*.spec.js`) observed  
- ❌ No package.json, .gitignore, or build scripts in scan  

> ⚠️ The project appears to be a minimal frontend-only application focused on UI for local file ingestion.

---

### 📝 Summary & Next Steps

**Current State**:  
A minimal React-based frontend app with styling and entry points. No backend logic or data processing observed.

**Next Action (aligned with task)**:  
> Begin implementing the **file picker component** in `src/App.tsx`, and update `src/styles.css` to support visual design of file selection and ingestion status.

**Potential Risks**:  
- Large CSS file may be hard to maintain — consider modularizing or extracting styles into component-specific files (if future expansion occurs).  
- No clear structure for ingestion pipeline logic → likely needs backend integration later, which is outside current scope.

✅ **Context Hydration Complete**  
All information derived from scan and payload. No assumptions beyond observed data.  
No missing elements were inferred — all gaps are explicitly stated.

> 📌 Final Note: This project appears to be a frontend-only MVP for local file ingestion with no backend or database components currently in place.
