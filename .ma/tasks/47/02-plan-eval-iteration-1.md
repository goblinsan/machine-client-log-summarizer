# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 1

Generated: 2025-11-22T04:45:04.711Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

{
  "status": "fail",
  "reason": "Plan introduces unsupported language: The plan does not specify any actual files to be modified, and the key_files array is empty for all steps. Without specific file paths or extensions that map to supported languages (e.g., .js, .ts, .py, etc.), it's not possible to validate the implementation. Additionally, the plan lacks concrete steps for modifying files and does not provide realistic acceptance criteria tied to specific code changes or behaviors."
