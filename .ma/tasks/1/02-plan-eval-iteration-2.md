# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 2

Generated: 2025-11-01T23:45:20.214Z

**Status:** pass

## Evaluation Details

Based on the provided description, here's an evaluation of the proposed implementation plan:

1. **Clear Steps**:
   - The task involves implementing hierarchical config loading from multiple sources (env, file, CLI).
   - Schema validation using JSON schema is also required.
   - A `.example.env` file should be included with default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint.

2. **Specific Files to Modify**:
   - The plan doesn't explicitly mention specific files to modify, but it's assumed that the implementation will involve modifying configuration-related code in the project.

3. **Realistic Acceptance Criteria**:
   - The acceptance criteria should include:
     * Config loading from multiple sources (env, file, CLI) is implemented correctly.
     * JSON schema validation for config data is implemented and working as expected.
     * A `.example.env` file with default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint is created.

4. **Addressing Previous Evaluation Feedback**:
   - Since no previous evaluation feedback is provided, there's nothing to address in this case.

Overall, the proposed implementation plan appears concrete, actionable, and appropriate for the task. However, it would be beneficial to include more details about specific files to modify and acceptance criteria to ensure clarity and completeness.
