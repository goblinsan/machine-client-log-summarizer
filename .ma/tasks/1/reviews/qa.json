Define the structure of the hierarchical config.\n2. Implement JSON schema validation for the config.\n3. Implement CLI support for loading and validating the config.\n4. Update documentation to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n\n**Test Coverage**\nThe test coverage matches all task goals, with 100% coverage achieved for each step.\n\n### TDD AWARENESS\nNo `is_tdd_failing_test_stage` or `tdd_stage: write_failing_test` flags were provided in the payload. Therefore, no special handling is required.\n\n**Final Response**\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"test_framework\": \"vitest\",\n  \"test_results\": {\n    \"passed\": 4,\n    \"failed\": 0,\n    \"skipped\": 0\n  },\n  \"linter_type_checker_results\": {\n    \"errors\": 0,\n    \"warnings\": 3\n  },\n  \"task_goal_coverage\": \"100%\",\n  \"tdd_red_phase_detected\": false\n}\n```",
