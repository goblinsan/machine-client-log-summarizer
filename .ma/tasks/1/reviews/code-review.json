However, the config structure and JSON schema are not explicitly defined in separate files as per the Implementation Plan.\n3. **Compile/syntax issues:** None found.\n4. **Organization problems:** The file structure is generally well-organized, but the README file does not include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support as per the Implementation Plan.\n5. **Lint violations:** Not applicable to this review.\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment:** The implementation deviates from the approved plan in Steps 1 and 2, where the config structure and JSON schema are not explicitly defined in separate files.\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT:** No language drift issues were found.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Create a separate file to define the config structure (Step 1).\n* Create a separate file to define the JSON schema (Step 2).\n* Update the README file to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support (Step 4).\n* Add documentation to the CLI implementation on how to load and validate the config (Step 3).",
