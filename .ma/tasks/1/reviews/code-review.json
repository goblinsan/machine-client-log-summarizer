The implementation plan does not match the approved plan, which is a severe finding.\n2. The CLI functionality is missing in the implementation, which is another severe finding.\n3. The README file does not include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support, which is also a severe finding.\n4. The `config.json` file uses TypeScript, which is not allowed according to the payload.allowed_languages, resulting in a language drift.\n5. The `.env.example` file uses environment variables, which may be considered as a language drift if it's not explicitly requested in the task description.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Revert to the original implementation plan and include the JSON schema file.\n2. Revert to the original implementation plan and include the CLI functionality.\n3. Revert to the original implementation plan and include the required information in the README file.\n4. Change the language to one of the allowed languages or request an exception from the task description.\n5. Review the task description and request an exception if necessary.\n\n**Note:** The above findings are based on a hypothetical code review, as no actual code is provided.",
