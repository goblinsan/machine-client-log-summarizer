This is a severe finding because it deviates from the approved language set.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate file (`schema.json`) to align with the implementation plan.\n2. Replace TypeScript with an approved language or update the task description to explicitly request TypeScript.\n\n**Additional Suggestions**\n\n1. Consider breaking down the `config.json` file into smaller files, each with a specific purpose, to improve maintainability and reduce complexity.\n2. Review the code for other potential issues, such as performance problems or major tech debt, and address them accordingly.",
