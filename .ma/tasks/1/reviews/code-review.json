Implement JSON schema validation for the config as per Step 2 of the plan.\n2. Implement CLI support for loading and validating the config from environment variables as per Step 3 of the plan.\n3. Update documentation to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support as per Step 4 of the plan.\n4. Review and update the config structure to handle potential conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift issues were found in the provided code.",
