Move the config structure definition to a separate file, e.g., `schema.json`.\n2. Change the file's language to match the approved plan or update the allowed languages in the payload.\n\n**Additional Findings**\n\n* The `.env.example` file should be included in the repository as a template for users to customize their config.\n* There is no implementation of JSON schema validation for the config, which is a dependency for Step 3.\n* There is no implementation of CLI support for loading and validating the config, which is a dependency for Step 4.\n\n**Task Goal Alignment**\n\nThe task goals are not fully aligned with the approved plan. The plan requires implementing JSON schema validation for the config (Step 2) and CLI support for loading and validating the config (Step 3), but these tasks are not implemented.\n\n**Severity Levels**\n\n* SEVERE: Plan deviations, language drift\n* HIGH: None\n* MEDIUM: None\n* LOW: Suggestions for refactoring opportunities",
