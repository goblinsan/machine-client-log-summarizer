Implement JSON schema validation as per Step 2 of the plan.\n2. Update the `.example.env` file to include placeholders for sensitive information.\n3. Regularly review and update documentation to reflect the current state of the project.\n4. Research and evaluate alternative libraries for improved performance and features.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift issues were found, as the modified files are in TypeScript (`.ts`) and JSON (`.json`), which are allowed languages based on the provided plan artifact.",
