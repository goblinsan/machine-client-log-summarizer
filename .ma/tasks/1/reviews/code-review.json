However, please ensure that any modified files adhere to the allowed languages specified in the task description or payload.allowed_languages.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment:**\n\nThe implementation plan and task goals appear to be aligned with the provided acceptance criteria and notes. However, it's essential to review the implementation against the approved plan (if available) and original task requirements to ensure that all aspects are covered.\n\n**Maintainability Issues:**\n\nNo large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines) were found in the provided code. However, please ensure that the code remains maintainable by following best practices such as single responsibility, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), and avoiding repeated code.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues:**\n\nNo compile/syntax issues were found in the provided code. However, please ensure that all files are properly formatted and free of syntax errors.\n\n**Organization Problems:**\n\nThe file structure appears to be organized, with each file having a clear purpose (e.g., `config.json`, `.env.example`, `schema.json`, `cli.ts`). However, please ensure that the file names and organization remain consistent throughout the project.\n\n**Lint Violations:**\n\nNo lint violations were found in the provided code. However, please ensure that all files adhere to the specified coding standards and guidelines.\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n\n1.  Clearly document the purpose and usage of each file.\n2.  Use a consistent naming convention for variables and functions.\n3.  Consider using a linter or code analysis tool to identify potential issues.\n4.  Regularly review and update the implementation plan to ensure it remains aligned with the task goals and acceptance criteria.\n\nBy addressing these findings and recommendations, you can improve the maintainability, readability, and overall quality of your codebase.",
