This is a SEVERE finding because it deviates from the approved plan.\n\n2. **Language Drift**: The `cli.ts` file uses TypeScript, which is not an allowed language according to the payload.allowed_languages (JavaScript and Python). This is also a SEVERE finding because it violates the task requirements.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Reorganize the code to define the config structure in a separate JSON file (`config.json`) as per the implementation plan.\n2. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or update the payload.allowed_languages to include TypeScript.\n\nNote: The above findings and recommendations are based on the provided implementation plan and task requirements.",
