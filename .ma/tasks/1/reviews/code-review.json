Code best practices:\n   - The code structure is well-defined with separate files for each step.\n   - Each file has a clear owner, which helps with accountability.\n\n2. Maintainability issues:\n   - There are no large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines).\n   - The logic is not overly complex, and the steps are well-organized.\n\n3. Compile/syntax issues:\n   - No syntax errors were found in the provided code snippets.\n   - However, it's essential to ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.\n\n4. Organization problems:\n   - The files are organized logically with clear names and owners.\n   - The README file will be updated to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n\n5. Lint violations:\n   - No linting errors were found in the provided code snippets.\n   - However, it's essential to run linters on all code before committing changes.\n\n6. Plan and task goal alignment:\n   - The implementation plan matches the approved plan from the artifact.\n   - All steps are aligned with the original task requirements.\n\n7. LANGUAGE DRIFT:\n   - No language drift was found in the provided code snippets.\n   - However, it's essential to ensure that all modified files use languages within the allowed set specified in the payload.\n\nThe only severe finding is related to conflicts between environment variables and file-based config, which should be handled by implementing a mechanism to resolve such conflicts. The other findings are medium-level suggestions for improvement.",
