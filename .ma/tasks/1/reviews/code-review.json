Assuming TypeScript (based on `cli.ts`), it aligns with the context_primary_language and context_secondary_languages provided.\n\n4. **Compile/Syntax Issues**: No syntax errors were found based on the information provided.\n\n5. **Lint Violations**: No lint violations were identified, but this would require running a linter tool against the codebase.\n\n6. **CRITICAL: Plan and Task Goal Alignment**:\n   - The implementation plan seems to align with the acceptance criteria for each step.\n   - However, there is no clear indication of how conflicts between environment variables and file-based config will be handled (Open Question 1).\n\n7. **Maintainability Issues**: No large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines) were identified based on the information provided.\n\n8. **Organization Problems**:\n   - The plan does not clearly indicate where the `README.md` file will be stored.\n   - There is no clear indication of how the project structure will be organized to accommodate these files.\n\n9. **Best Practices (Single Responsibility, DRY, Avoiding Repeated Code)**:\n   - No repeated code was identified based on the information provided.\n   - However, without seeing the actual implementation, it's difficult to assess single responsibility and DRY principles.\n\n10. **Summary**: The plan seems well-structured, but there are some areas that could be improved for clarity and organization.",
