Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each file has a clear responsibility, but some files might benefit from being split into smaller ones for better maintainability.\n2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): The code seems to follow the DRY principle, with minimal repetition.\n3. Avoid Repeated Code: No repeated code was found.\n\n**Maintainability Issues**\n\n1. Large Files (>500 lines): None of the files exceed 500 lines.\n2. Long Methods (>100 lines): Some methods might benefit from being split into smaller ones for better readability and maintainability.\n3. Complex Nested Logic: The code does not exhibit complex nested logic.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues**\n\nNone found.\n\n**Organization Problems**\n\n1. Poor File Structure: The file structure seems reasonable, with each file having a clear responsibility.\n2. Unclear Naming: The naming conventions are consistent throughout the codebase.\n\n**Lint Violations**\n\nNone found.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT**\n\nNo language drift was detected in the provided files.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\nThe implementation plan aligns with the approved plan and original task requirements, except for the open question regarding conflicts between environment variables and file-based config. This issue is flagged as a high-priority finding.\n\n**SEVERE FINDINGS**\n\nNone found.\n\n**HIGH FINDINGS**\n\n1. Conflict handling: The code does not provide a mechanism to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n2. JSON schema version documentation: The chosen JSON schema version is not documented in the `schema.json` file.\n\n**MEDIUM FINDINGS**\n\n1. JSON schema version compatibility: No documentation on the JSON schema version used exists.\n2. README update: The README file does not explicitly mention handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**LOW FINDINGS**\n\nNone found.",
