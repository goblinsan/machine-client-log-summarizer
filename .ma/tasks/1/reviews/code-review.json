Move the config structure definition to a separate file, e.g., `schema.json`.\n2.  Replace TypeScript with an authorized language or update the task description to reflect the use of TypeScript.\n3.  Update the .example.env file to include the required default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint.\n\n**Task Goal Alignment:**\n\nThe implementation plan has been deviated from in multiple areas:\n\n1.  The config structure is not defined in a separate JSON file as per the implementation plan.\n2.  The .example.env file does not contain default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint as per the implementation plan.\n\n**Plan Artifact Validation:**\n\nThe provided plan artifact has been used to validate the implementation against the approved plan.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nThe modified files (`config.json` and `.env.example`) use languages outside the allowed set (TypeScript). This is a severe finding, and the task description does not explicitly request the use of TypeScript.",
