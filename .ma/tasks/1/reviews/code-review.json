This deviates from the approved plan and is a critical issue.\n2. **MEDIUM findings**:\n   - The documentation does not explicitly mention how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config, which is an open question mentioned in the plan.\n   - The `.example.env` file lacks clear instructions for users to customize their config from this template file.\n\nThe code review did not find any compile/syntax issues or language drift. However, it identified some maintainability issues and organization problems that need attention.",
