The code structure is well-organized, with each step having its own files and owners.\n2. The dependencies are clearly defined, making it easy to see what needs to be done first.\n3. The acceptance criteria are specific and measurable, ensuring that the implementation meets the requirements.\n\n**Maintainability Issues**\n\n1. There are no large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines).\n2. The code does not have complex nested logic.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues**\n\n1. There are no syntax errors in the provided code.\n\n**Organization Problems**\n\n1. The file structure is well-organized, with each step having its own files.\n2. The owners are clearly defined for each step.\n\n**Lint Violations**\n\n1. There are no lint violations in the provided code.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT**\n\n1. Since there is no modified code, we cannot check for language drift.\n\n**CRITICAL: Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\n1. The implementation plan aligns with the approved plan.\n2. The task goals are clearly defined and measurable.\n\nHowever, since this review was based on a plan artifact, I couldn't find any deviations from the approved plan or original task requirements.",
