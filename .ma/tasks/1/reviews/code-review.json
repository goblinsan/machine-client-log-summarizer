Code best practices:\n   - The code structure is well-defined with separate files for each step.\n   - Each file has a clear owner and dependencies.\n\n2. Maintainability issues:\n   - There are no large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines).\n   - The nested logic is not complex, but it would be beneficial to break down the implementation into smaller functions.\n\n3. Compile/syntax issues:\n   - No syntax errors were found in the provided code snippets.\n\n4. Organization problems:\n   - The file structure is clear and organized.\n   - The naming conventions are consistent.\n\n5. Lint violations:\n   - No linting errors were reported for the provided code snippets.\n\n6. Plan and task goal alignment:\n   - The implementation matches the approved plan from the iteration 2 artifact.\n   - However, there is a SEVERE finding due to the lack of a clear conflict resolution strategy between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n7. LANGUAGE DRIFT:\n   - No language drift was found in the provided code snippets.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n- Update the implementation to include a conflict resolution strategy for handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n- Consider breaking down the implementation into smaller functions to improve maintainability.\n- Add more detailed documentation on how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.",
