Missing implementation of hierarchical config structure as per plan.\n2. JSON schema validation implementation is missing.\n3. CLI support for loading and validating the config is incomplete.\n\n**HIGH Findings:**\n\n1. Default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint are not clearly documented in .env.example.\n2. Information about the hierarchical config is missing from the README file.\n\n**MEDIUM Findings:**\n\n1. Config structure could be improved for better readability and maintainability in config.json.\n2. JSON schema validation rules are not clearly documented in schema.json.\n\n**LOW Findings:**\n\n1. The .example.env file could be improved for better readability and maintainability.\n2. Information about CLI support is missing from the README file.\n\nNote that this review has identified several SEVERE findings, which indicate a failure to meet the plan's requirements. As a result, the overall status of the review is set to \"fail\".",
