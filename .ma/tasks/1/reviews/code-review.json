This is a severe finding because it deviates from the original task requirements.\n3. **Plan Deviation:** The CLI support was not implemented in a separate file as per the approved plan.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Reorganize the code to match the original plan.\n2. Update the language of the schema.json file to match the allowed languages or add TypeScript as an allowed language.\n3. Reorganize the code to improve readability and maintainability.",
