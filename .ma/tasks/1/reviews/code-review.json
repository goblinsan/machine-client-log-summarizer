Move the config structure definition to a separate file.\n2. Update the language of the schema.json file to match the allowed languages or add TypeScript as an allowed language.\n3. Implement the JSON schema validation in the CLI.\n\nNote: This review is based on the provided plan and task requirements, but it does not include a thorough code review of the actual implementation.",
