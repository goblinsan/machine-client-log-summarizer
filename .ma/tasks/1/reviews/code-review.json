The plan iteration includes multiple steps, but there is no clear indication of how these steps will be integrated into a cohesive implementation.\n2. There are no specific guidelines for coding standards, testing, or documentation in the provided plan.\n3. The acceptance criteria for each step are not comprehensive and may lead to incomplete or incorrect implementations.\n\n**Implementation Plan Alignment:**\n\n1. Step 1 defines the structure of the hierarchical config, but there is no clear indication of how this will be implemented in code.\n2. Step 2 implements JSON schema validation for the config, but it does not specify which library or approach will be used.\n3. Step 3 provides CLI support for loading and validating the config, but it does not detail the implementation details.\n4. Step 4 updates documentation to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support, but it does not provide specific guidelines for documentation standards.\n\n**Task Goal Alignment:**\n\n1. The plan iteration aims to implement a hierarchical config with JSON schema validation and CLI support.\n2. However, there is no clear indication of how these features will be integrated into a cohesive implementation or how they will meet the acceptance criteria.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\n1. There are no specific language requirements mentioned in the plan iteration.\n2. Assuming that the implementation will use TypeScript (based on the `cli.ts` file), we can check for language drift by comparing the modified files against the allowed languages (`TypeScript`).\n3. Since there is no explicit request for other languages, any unauthorized language usage should be flagged as a SEVERE finding.\n\n**Code Organization and Naming:**\n\n1. The plan iteration does not provide specific guidelines for code organization or naming conventions.\n2. It would be beneficial to establish clear coding standards and documentation guidelines to ensure consistency throughout the implementation.",
