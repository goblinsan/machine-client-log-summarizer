Reorganize the code to match the approved plan.\n2. Replace TypeScript with JavaScript or add TypeScript to the allowed languages.\n\n**Additional suggestions:**\n\n1. Consider using a more robust configuration management system, such as etcd or ZooKeeper, to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n2. Update the documentation to include information about handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n3. Review the code for other potential issues, such as maintainability problems or lint violations.\n\n**Code review:**\n\nThe provided plan iteration 2 does not contain any code snippets for review. However, based on the description of the tasks, here are some potential code organization and language drift issues:\n\n1. The config structure is defined in a single JSON file (config.json), which may lead to maintainability problems if the configuration becomes complex.\n2. The schema.json file uses TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages (JavaScript).\n3. The cli.ts file loads and validates the config against the JSON schema, but it does not handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**Code organization suggestions:**\n\n1. Consider breaking down the config structure into multiple files or modules to improve maintainability.\n2. Use a more robust configuration management system to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**Language drift suggestions:**\n\n1. Replace TypeScript with JavaScript in the schema.json file.\n2. Add TypeScript to the allowed languages if it is required for the project.",
