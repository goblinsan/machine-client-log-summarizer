The plan does not specify which JSON schema version to use for config validation, which is critical for ensuring compatibility and security.\n2. There are no clear instructions on how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config, which could lead to inconsistencies in the system's behavior.\n3. The plan does not define a process for updating the README file with information about the hierarchical config and CLI support, which could lead to outdated documentation.\n4. The plan does not specify how to handle unsupported JSON schema versions, which could lead to errors or security vulnerabilities.\n5. The .example.env file should be included in the repository as a template for users to customize their config, but this is not explicitly stated.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Specify the JSON schema version to be used for config validation in the plan.\n2. Define a strategy to resolve conflicts between environment variables and file-based config in the plan or documentation.\n3. Define a process for updating the README file with information about the hierarchical config and CLI support in the plan or documentation.\n4. Define a strategy to handle unsupported JSON schema versions in the plan or documentation.\n5. Clearly state that the .example.env file should be included in the repository as a template.",
