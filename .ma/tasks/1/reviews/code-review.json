This is a severe finding.\n2. **Task goal misalignment**: The .example.env file contains default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint, which is not explicitly requested in the task description. This is a severe finding.\n3. **Plan deviation**: The CLI does not validate the config against the JSON schema as per the approved plan. This is a severe finding.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate file, e.g., `schema.json`.\n2. Implement JSON schema validation for the config in the CLI code.\n3. Remove or refactor the .example.env file to align with the approved plan.\n4. Update the README file to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n\n**Note**: The above findings are based on a manual review of the provided implementation plan and task description. A more thorough analysis may reveal additional issues.",
