This is a severe issue that requires immediate attention.\n2. **Unauthorized language drift:** The `cli.ts` file uses TypeScript, but the allowed languages are JavaScript and Python. This is a severe issue that requires immediate attention.\n3. **Major tech debt:** The `.example.env` file contains hardcoded values for log paths and store. This is a high-priority issue that should be addressed as soon as possible.\n4. **Performance issue:** The JSON schema validation library may introduce performance overhead. This is a high-priority issue that should be monitored and optimized if necessary.\n5. **Code smell:** The `config.json` file contains redundant comments. This is a medium-priority issue that can be addressed in the future.\n6. **Style issue:** The `README.md` file lacks a clear and concise summary of the hierarchical config and CLI support. This is a medium-priority issue that can be addressed in the future.\n7. **Refactoring opportunity:** The `cli.ts` code can be simplified using a more efficient validation approach. This is a low-priority issue that can be addressed in the future.\n8. **Code smell:** The `schema.json` file contains unused properties. This is a low-priority issue that can be addressed in the future.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Revisit the implementation plan and align it with the approved plan.\n2. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or update the task description to reflect the use of TypeScript.\n3. Remove hardcoded values from the `.example.env` file and replace them with environment variables or a more robust configuration mechanism.\n4. Monitor the application's performance and consider optimizing the schema validation process if necessary.\n5. Remove redundant comments from the `config.json` file.\n6. Update the `README.md` file to provide a clear and concise summary of the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n7. Consider refactoring the `cli.ts` code to improve its maintainability and performance.\n8. Remove unused properties from the `schema.json` file.",
