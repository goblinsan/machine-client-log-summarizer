Each file has a specific purpose, and there is no excessive coupling between files.\n2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: The code follows the DRY principle. There is no repeated code or logic.\n\n**Maintainability Issues:**\n\n1. **Large Files**: None of the files exceed 500 lines.\n2. **Long Methods**: None of the methods exceed 100 lines.\n3. **Complex Nested Logic**: The code does not have complex nested logic.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues:**\n\n1. **No syntax errors**: The code does not contain any syntax errors.\n\n**Organization Problems:**\n\n1. **Poor File Structure**: The file structure is clear, and each file has a specific purpose.\n2. **Unclear Naming**: The naming conventions are consistent throughout the code.\n\n**Lint Violations:**\n\n1. **No lint violations**: The code does not contain any lint violations.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT:**\n\n1. **Language Drift**: There is no language drift in the modified files. All files use a compatible language (TypeScript).\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment:**\n\n1. **Plan Deviation**: There are no deviations from the approved plan.\n2. **Task Goal Misalignment**: The code aligns with the task goals.\n\n**SEVERE Findings:**\n\nNone\n\n**HIGH Findings:**\n\nNone\n\n**MEDIUM Findings:**\n\n1. The config structure is not clearly defined in the code. Consider using a separate file or module to define the structure.\n2. The JSON schema is not validated against the config. Consider adding validation logic in the code.\n\n**LOW Findings:**\n\n1. The README file does not include information about the hierarchical config. Consider adding a section to explain the config structure.",
