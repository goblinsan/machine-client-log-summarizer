This is a severe finding because it deviates from the approved plan.\n2. **Language Drift:** The `schema.json` file uses TypeScript, which is not part of the allowed languages according to the payload. This is a severe finding because it violates the task requirements.\n3. **Plan Deviation (CLI Support):** The implementation plan specified that the CLI should load and validate the config against the JSON schema, but the current implementation only loads the config from environment variables without validation. This is a severe finding because it deviates from the approved plan.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate file.\n2. Use a language that is part of the allowed set or update the task description to explicitly request TypeScript.\n3. Implement the CLI to load and validate the config against the JSON schema.",
