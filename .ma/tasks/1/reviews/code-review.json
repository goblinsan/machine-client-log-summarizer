The approved plan specifies that the config structure should be defined in a JSON file, but the implementation deviates from this plan.\n2. **HIGH:** Language drift in `.env.example`. The file uses shell syntax, which is not allowed according to the payload.allowed_languages.\n3. **MEDIUM:** Code smell in `README.md` and `cli.ts`. The README file lacks information about the hierarchical config, and the CLI implementation could be improved for maintainability.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Revisit the implementation of `config.json` and `schema.json` to align it with the approved plan.\n2. Replace shell syntax in `.env.example` with a supported language or update the task description to request this language.\n3. Update the README file to include information about the hierarchical config.\n4. Refactor the CLI implementation in `cli.ts` to improve its structure and maintainability.",
