However, I have identified some potential issues and suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Plan implementation**: The plan does not specify any code changes or implementation details. It's essential to ensure that all tasks are completed and reviewed before proceeding.\n2. **.example.env file**: The plan mentions including the .example.env file in the repository as a template, but it's unclear how this will be implemented. Update the implementation plan to include details on how the .example.env file will be handled.\n\n**Language Drift**\n\nSince there are no code changes, there is no language drift to report.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\nThe provided plan does not specify any specific tasks or implementation details. Therefore, it's challenging to assess whether the implementation matches the approved plan and original task requirements.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Complete the implementation of Plan Iteration 2.\n2. Update the implementation plan to include details on how the .example.env file will be handled.\n3. Ensure that all tasks are completed and reviewed before proceeding with further development.",
