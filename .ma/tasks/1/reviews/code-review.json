Update the plan to include a detailed description of the config structure, JSON schema definition, and CLI implementation.\n2. Specify default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in the .example.env file.\n3. Address the open question about handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift issues were found as the plan does not specify any particular programming languages or technologies to be used during implementation.",
