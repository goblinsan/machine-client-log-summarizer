Move the config structure definition to a separate file as per the plan.\n2. Implement conflict resolution logic for environment variables and file-based config in the CLI.\n3. Update the README file to reflect the current implementation of the hierarchical config.\n\n**Language Drift**\n\nNo language drift issues were found, as all modified files are written in TypeScript, which is allowed by the payload.allowed_languages (TypeScript) and context_primary_language (TypeScript).",
