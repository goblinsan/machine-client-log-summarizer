However, complex nested logic in `config.json` could be improved for better maintainability.\n3. **Compile/syntax issues:** None found.\n4. **Organization problems:** Poor file structure and unclear naming conventions are not explicitly addressed in the implementation plan.\n5. **Lint violations:** Not applicable as this is a high-level review of an implementation plan, not actual code.\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment:** The implementation plan aligns with the approved plan and original task requirements.\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT:** No language drift was found.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Define a clear structure for the hierarchical config in `config.json`.\n2. Choose a compatible JSON schema validation library and update the implementation accordingly.\n3. Document default values clearly in the `.example.env` file or README.md.\n4. Update the README.md to include clear information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n5. Implement a mechanism to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**SEVERE findings:** None\n\n**HIGH findings:**\n\n1. No clear structure defined for the hierarchical config in `config.json`.\n2. JSON schema validation library not specified.\n\n**MEDIUM findings:**\n\n1. Default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint not clearly documented.\n2. Information about hierarchical config and CLI support not clearly outlined.\n\n**LOW findings:**\n\n1. Config file does not handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.",
