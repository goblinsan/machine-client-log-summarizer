This is a severe finding because it deviates from the approved language set.\n3. **Code smell:** The .example.env file contains default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint. While this is not a critical issue, it's worth reviewing the file structure and considering refactoring.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate JSON file as per the plan.\n2. Replace TypeScript with an approved language or request an exception in the task description.\n3. Review the file structure and consider refactoring the .example.env file.",
