The plan's acceptance criteria for Step 4 mention that the README file should include information about CLI support and hierarchical config, but it does not address conflict resolution strategies between environment variables and file-based config.\n\nHowever, since this is an open question in the plan, it may be considered as a discussion point rather than a critical issue. Nevertheless, including this information in the documentation would improve user experience and reduce potential issues.\n\nAs for language drift, no unauthorized languages were detected in the provided files. The implementation plan does not specify any specific programming languages or frameworks, so we cannot assess LANGUAGE DRIFT without more context.\n\nThe review did not find any compile/syntax issues, maintainability problems, organization issues, lint violations, or significant deviations from the approved plan or task goals.",
