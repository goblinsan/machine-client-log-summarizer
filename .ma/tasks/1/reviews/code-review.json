Similarly, the .env.example file uses environment variables, which are not an allowed language.\n3. **Code smell**: The config structure is not well-organized, making it difficult to maintain.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Reorganize the code to follow the original plan.\n2. Replace TypeScript with one of the allowed languages or update the payload.allowed_languages to include TypeScript.\n3. Replace environment variables with one of the allowed languages or update the payload.allowed_languages to include environment variables.\n4. Reorganize the config structure to improve readability and maintainability.\n\n**Status**\n\nThe status is set to \"fail\" due to multiple severe findings, including plan deviations and language drift.",
