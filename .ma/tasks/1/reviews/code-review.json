This is a severe finding because it deviates from the approved implementation plan.\n2. **Language drift**: The .example.env file uses a non-approved language (e.g., Bash). This is a severe finding because it uses an unauthorized language without explicit request in the task description.\n3. **Code smell**: The CLI implementation has a long method (>100 lines). This is a medium-level finding because it's not a critical issue but can be improved for maintainability.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Revisit the implementation and ensure it aligns with the approved plan.\n2. Replace the non-approved language with an approved one or request an exception in the task description.\n3. Refactor the code to break down the long method into smaller, more manageable functions.",
