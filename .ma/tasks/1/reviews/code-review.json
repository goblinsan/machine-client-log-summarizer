The code review did not find any severe issues, such as compile errors or critical bugs.\n2. However, it found some high-priority issues:\n   - Missing JSON schema validation for the config structure (Step 2 of the implementation plan).\n   - Default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint are not defined in a clear and maintainable way (.env.example file).\n3. The code review also identified some medium-priority issues:\n   - Documentation does not clearly explain how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config (README.md file).\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Implement JSON schema validation for the config structure as per Step 2 of the implementation plan.\n2. Consider using environment variables or a separate configuration file for default values in .env.example.\n3. Update the README file to include information about handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\nNote that this code review did not find any language drift issues, as the provided implementation plan does not specify any allowed languages. If you need to check for language drift, please provide the payload.allowed_languages or context_primary_language and context_secondary_languages values.",
