Reorganize the code to match the approved plan.\n2. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or update the payload.allowed_languages.\n\n**Additional Findings:**\n\n* The .example.env file should be included in the repository as a template for users to customize their config, but there is no evidence of this being implemented.\n* There are no files named `config.json` and `.env.example` that match the approved plan.",
