The code review found multiple severe findings, including plan deviations and language drift.\n2. The config structure is not defined in a JSON file as per the approved plan (Step 1).\n3. The JSON schema is not defined in a separate file as per the approved plan (Step 2).\n4. The `cli.ts` file uses TypeScript, but this language is not included in the allowed languages.\n5. The `.example.env` file contains default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint, which is not mentioned in the approved plan.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Revert to the original implementation and re-generate the config structure according to the plan (Step 1).\n2. Revert to the original implementation and re-generate the JSON schema according to the plan (Step 2).\n3. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or update the task description to include TypeScript as an authorized language.\n4. Revert to the original implementation and re-generate the `.example.env` file according to the plan.\n\n**Note:** The code review did not find any other severe findings, high issues, medium problems, or low suggestions.",
