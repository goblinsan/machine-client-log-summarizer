The `config.json` file does not define the config structure in a separate JSON file as per the implementation plan. The `schema.json` file uses TypeScript, which is not allowed in the context_primary_language and context_secondary_languages. The CLI does not load the config from a file or environment variables as per the acceptance criteria. The `.example.env` file does not contain default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint as per the implementation plan.\n\nTo address these issues, the following recommendations are provided:\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate file.\n2. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or update the task description to explicitly request TypeScript.\n3. Update the CLI to load the config from a file or environment variables.\n4. Update the `.example.env` file to include default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint.\n\nAdditionally, there is a code smell in the `config.json` file regarding the organization of the config structure. It can be improved by reorganizing it for better readability and maintainability.",
