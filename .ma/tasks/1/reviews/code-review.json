The plan iteration review found several severe issues, including the lack of implementation details for each step.\n2. There are no high-level findings, but a medium-level issue was identified regarding handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n3. No low-level suggestions were made.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Provide detailed implementation plans for each step in the iteration plan.\n2. Address the medium-level issue by providing a description of how conflicts will be handled between environment variables and file-based config.\n3. Update the documentation to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support as per Step 4.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift was detected, as the task description does not explicitly request any specific languages. However, it is recommended to review the code for compliance with the allowed languages (if specified) in future iterations.",
