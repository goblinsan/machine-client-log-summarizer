The implementation plan is clear and well-structured.\n2. The dependencies between tasks are correctly specified.\n3. The acceptance criteria for each task are clearly defined.\n\nHowever, there are some areas that could be improved:\n\n1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Some tasks seem to have multiple responsibilities (e.g., Task 2: Implement JSON schema validation and define the structure of the hierarchical config).\n2. **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** The implementation plan does not specify how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config, which could lead to duplicated code.\n3. **Avoid Repeated Code:** There is no clear indication of how the .example.env file will be implemented, which could lead to repeated code.\n\nTo address these issues, it's recommended to update the implementation plan to include more details on how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config, and to specify what information should be included in the README file. Additionally, consider breaking down larger tasks into smaller ones to improve SRP and DRY adherence.",
