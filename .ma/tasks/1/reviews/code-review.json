Implement JSON schema validation as per Step 2 of the implementation plan.\n2. Define default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in the code or provide a clear explanation of how they should be set.\n3. Update the README file to include instructions on how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift detected. The implementation plan does not specify any allowed languages, so no severe findings are reported for this category.",
