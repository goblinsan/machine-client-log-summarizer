The code structure is not well-defined, and it seems like some tasks are missing implementation details.\n2.  There's no clear plan for handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n3.  The .example.env file should be included in the repository as a template for users to customize their config.\n\n**Maintainability Issues**\n\n1.  Large files: None\n2.  Long methods: None\n3.  Complex nested logic: None\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues**\n\n1.  There are no syntax errors in the provided code.\n2.  However, there's a missing implementation of the hierarchical config structure and JSON schema validation.\n\n**Organization Problems**\n\n1.  Poor file structure: The files seem to be well-organized, but some tasks are missing implementation details.\n2.  Unclear naming: The variable names are clear, but it would be better to provide more context about what each task is implementing.\n\n**Lint Violations**\n\n1.  There are no lint violations in the provided code.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT**\n\n1.  No language drift detected.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\n1.  The plan seems well-structured, but some tasks are missing implementation details.\n2.  It's unclear if the task goals have been met due to incomplete implementation details.\n\n**CRITICAL: Plan and Task Goal Alignment - Validate Implementation Matches the Approved Plan (from plan_artifact if provided) AND Original Task Requirements**\n\n1.  The plan seems well-structured, but some tasks are missing implementation details.\n2.  It's unclear if the task goals have been met due to incomplete implementation details.\n\n**SEVERE Findings**\n\n1.  Missing implementation of hierarchical config structure as per plan.\n2.  Default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint are not implemented as per plan.\n3.  JSON schema validation implementation is missing.\n4.  CLI support for loading and validating the config is not implemented as per plan.\n\n**HIGH Findings**\n\n1.  JSON schema validation library should be specified.\n2.  CLI implementation is incomplete.\n\n**MEDIUM Findings**\n\n1.  Documentation update to include information about hierarchical config and CLI support is missing.\n2.  The .example.env file should be included in the repository as a template for users to customize their config, but it's not clear if this is implemented.\n\n**LOW Findings**\n\n1.  Consider adding comments to explain the purpose of each field in the config structure.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1.  Implement the defined structure in the JSON file.\n2.  Populate default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in the .example.env file.\n3.  Implement JSON schema validation as per plan.\n4.  Implement CLI support as per plan.\n5.  Update the README file with the required information.\n6.  Verify that the .example.env file is included in the repository.\n7.  Add comments to improve code readability and maintainability.",
