However, I will provide some suggestions for improvement.\n\n1. **Code organization:** The plan does not specify a clear file structure or naming convention. It would be beneficial to establish a consistent approach to organizing files and code.\n2. **Language drift:** Since the task description does not explicitly request specific languages, it is essential to ensure that all modified files use only the allowed languages (e.g., TypeScript). If any unauthorized language drift occurs, it should be flagged as a SEVERE finding.\n\nTo address these suggestions, I recommend reviewing the code and implementing the following:\n\n1. Establish a clear file structure and naming convention.\n2. Verify that all modified files use only the allowed languages (TypeScript).\n\nIf you provide the actual code for review, I can offer more specific feedback on maintainability issues, lint violations, and other potential concerns.\n\n**Example of how to flag language drift:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"fail\",\n  \"summary\": \"Language drift detected.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"cli.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"Unauthorized language drift: JavaScript used in cli.ts instead of TypeScript.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Replace JavaScript with TypeScript.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide the actual code for a more comprehensive review.",
