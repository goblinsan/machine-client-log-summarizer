Define a clear and concise structure for the hierarchical config.\n2. Provide clear explanations and documentation for the default values in the .example.env file.\n3. Define a clear and concise JSON schema for the config.\n4. Update the README file to include information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n5. Document the CLI support clearly.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift issues were found in the provided implementation plan.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment:**\n\nThe implementation plan aligns with the approved plan and original task requirements.",
