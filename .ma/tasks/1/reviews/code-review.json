This deviation from the plan requires immediate attention.\n2. **Language Drift**: The `schema.json` file uses TypeScript syntax, which is not allowed according to the payload.allowed_languages (JavaScript and JSON). This language drift requires correction to ensure compliance with the allowed languages.\n3. **Code Smell**: The config structure in `config.json` is not properly nested, making it difficult to read and maintain. Reorganizing the config structure can improve readability.\n4. **Code Smell**: The CLI code in `cli.ts` lacks proper comments, making it challenging for others to understand. Adding comments can improve readability.\n5. **Suggestion**: The README file could be improved by adding more detailed information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate JSON file as per the implementation plan.\n2. Update the `schema.json` file to use JavaScript or JSON syntax.\n3. Reorganize the config structure in `config.json` to improve readability.\n4. Add comments to the CLI code in `cli.ts` to improve readability.\n5. Update the README file to include more detailed information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\n1. Address the plan deviation by moving the config structure definition to a separate JSON file.\n2. Correct the language drift by updating the `schema.json` file to use JavaScript or JSON syntax.\n3. Reorganize the config structure in `config.json` to improve readability.\n4. Add comments to the CLI code in `cli.ts` to improve readability.\n5. Update the README file to include more detailed information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.",
