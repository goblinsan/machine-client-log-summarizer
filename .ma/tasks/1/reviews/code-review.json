The config structure was not defined in a separate file as per the implementation plan, which is a SEVERE finding.\n2. The schema.json file uses TypeScript, which is not allowed according to the payload.allowed_languages, resulting in a SEVERE finding.\n3. The CLI support was implemented in a TypeScript file, but the implementation plan specified a JavaScript file, leading to a SEVERE finding.\n4. The .example.env file uses shell scripting, which is not allowed according to the payload.allowed_languages, causing another SEVERE finding.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate file.\n2. Change the language of the schema.json file to one of the allowed languages.\n3. Update the implementation plan or change the language of the cli.ts file to one of the allowed languages.\n4. Change the language of the .example.env file to one of the allowed languages.\n\n**Note:** The above findings and recommendations are based on the provided implementation plan and payload.allowed_languages. You may need to adjust them according to your specific requirements.",
