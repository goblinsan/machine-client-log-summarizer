It would be better to create a separate file for the config schema.**\n   - File: `config.json`\n   - Recommendation: Create a separate file for the config schema and import it into the main config file.\n\n2. **The .example.env file contains default values, but it's not clear how these values will be used in the code.**\n   - File: `.env.example`\n   - Recommendation: Add comments to explain how the default values are used and how users can customize their config.\n\n**LOW FINDINGS**\n\n1. **The README file could include more information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.**\n   - File: `README.md`\n   - Recommendation: Add a section to the README file that explains how to use the hierarchical config and CLI support.",
