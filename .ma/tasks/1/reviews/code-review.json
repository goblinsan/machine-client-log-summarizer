It would be better to have a more organized file structure.\n   - There are no comments or docstrings explaining the purpose of each file or function.\n\n2. **Maintainability issues**: \n   - The codebase is not modular, making it difficult to maintain and update individual components.\n   - There are no tests for the CLI support implementation.\n\n3. **Compile/syntax issues**:\n   - None found in the provided plan artifact.\n\n4. **Organization problems**:\n   - The file structure is not clear, and there are multiple files with similar names (e.g., `config.json` and `.env.example`).\n   - There are no comments or docstrings explaining the purpose of each file or function.\n\n5. **Lint violations**: \n   - None found in the provided plan artifact.\n\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment**:\n   - The config structure is not defined in a separate JSON file as per the approved plan.\n   - The CLI support implementation does not match the approved plan.\n\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**:\n   - The `schema.json` file uses TypeScript, which is not allowed according to the payload.allowed_languages.\n   - The task description should be updated to include TypeScript as an exception or change the language of the `schema.json` file to a supported one.",
