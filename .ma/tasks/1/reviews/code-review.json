The config structure was not defined in a separate JSON file as per the implementation plan, which is a severe finding.\n2. The JSON schema was not defined in a separate file as per the implementation plan, which is another severe finding.\n3. The `cli.ts` file uses TypeScript, but the allowed languages are JavaScript and Python, which is a language drift issue.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Reorganize the code to define the config structure in a separate JSON file.\n2. Reorganize the code to define the JSON schema in a separate file.\n3. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or update the payload.allowed_languages to include TypeScript.",
