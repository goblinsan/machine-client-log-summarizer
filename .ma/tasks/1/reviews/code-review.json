The config structure is not clearly defined in `config.json`.\n2. The `.example.env` file contains default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint, but it's not clear how these values are used in the code.\n3. The README file could be improved by including more detailed information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n\n**LOW findings:**\n\n1. Consider adding more sections or subsections to `README.md` to provide a clearer overview of the project.",
