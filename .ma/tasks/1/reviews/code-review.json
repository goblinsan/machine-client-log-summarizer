The plan seems to follow the single responsibility principle by separating tasks among different team members.\n2. It adheres to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by avoiding repeated code.\n3. However, it would be beneficial to include more details about the implementation, such as file structures and coding standards.\n\n**Maintainability Issues:**\n\n1. The plan does not specify any large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines).\n2. It also does not mention any complex nested logic that could make the code difficult to maintain.\n3. However, it would be beneficial to include more details about the implementation, such as file structures and coding standards.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues:**\n\n1. The plan does not specify any compile or syntax issues.\n2. Since no code was provided, it is impossible to identify any potential issues.\n\n**Organization Problems:**\n\n1. The plan seems well-organized with clear tasks and acceptance criteria for each step.\n2. However, it would be beneficial to include more details about the implementation, such as file structures and coding standards.\n\n**Lint Violations:**\n\n1. Since no code was provided, it is impossible to identify any potential lint violations.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment:**\n\n1. The plan seems well-aligned with the approved plan and original task requirements.\n2. However, it would be beneficial to include more details about the implementation, such as file structures and coding standards.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT:**\n\n1. Since no code was provided, it is impossible to identify any potential language drift issues.\n\nTo improve this review, please provide the actual code for the implementation, and I will be happy to assist you further.",
