Additionally, default values in `.env.example` are not validated against the JSON schema.\n2. **HIGH findings:** Documentation in `README.md` does not explicitly mention how conflicts between environment variables and file-based config are handled. The CLI implementation in `cli.ts` lacks validation for unsupported JSON schema versions.\n3. **MEDIUM finding:** The JSON schema version used might not be compatible with future config validation library updates, which is a potential issue that needs to be addressed through regular reviews and updates of the schema.\n4. **LOW findings:** None.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Implement JSON schema validation for the config structure defined in `config.json`.\n2. Update `.env.example` to include only default values that match the JSON schema.\n3. Update `README.md` to include information about conflict resolution between environment variables and file-based config.\n4. Implement a check for unsupported JSON schema versions in `cli.ts`.\n5. Regularly review and update the JSON schema to ensure compatibility with new library versions.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift issues were found, as all modified files are written in TypeScript, which is within the allowed languages specified in the task description.",
