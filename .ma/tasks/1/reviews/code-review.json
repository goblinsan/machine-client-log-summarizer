The plan iteration includes a clear implementation plan with specific files, owners, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.\n2. However, there are some issues that need attention:\n   - In Step 3, the CLI support for loading and validating the config is implemented in `cli.ts`, but it's not clear how the JSON schema validation will be performed.\n   - The README file should include information about conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n   - There are no code files provided to review, so we can't check for compile/syntax issues or lint violations.\n\n**Plan Deviation:**\n\n1. In Step 2, it's mentioned that the JSON schema is defined in a separate file (`schema.json`), but there's no indication of how this schema will be used for validation.\n2. The plan doesn't specify how conflicts between environment variables and file-based config will be handled.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\n1. No language drift issues were found, as the provided files are not actual code files.\n\n**Code Best Practices:**\n\n1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n3. Avoiding Repeated Code: Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n\n**Maintainability Issues:**\n\n1. Large files (>500 lines): Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n2. Long methods (>100 lines): Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n3. Complex nested logic: Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n\n**Organization Problems:**\n\n1. Poor file structure: Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n2. Unclear naming: Not applicable, as no code is provided.\n\n**Lint Violations:**\n\n1. No lint violations were found, as no code is provided.\n\nNote that this review is based on the provided plan iteration and does not include any actual code files for review.",
