Define a clear structure for the hierarchical config in `config.json`.\n2. Document default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in `.env.example` file.\n3. Provide clear documentation on how to define the JSON schema in `schema.json`.\n4. Include clear information about the hierarchical config and CLI support in `README.md`.\n5. Include the `.example.env` file in the repository as a template for users to customize their config.\n\n**Status:** pass\n\nNote: This review is based on the provided plan artifact and task requirements. If any deviations from the approved plan or task goals are found, they will be flagged as SEVERE findings.",
