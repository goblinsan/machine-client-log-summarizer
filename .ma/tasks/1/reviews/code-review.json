The plan deviation in `config.json` is due to the fact that it was not defined in a separate file as per the implementation plan.\n2. The language drift in `schema.json` is because it uses TypeScript, but the allowed languages are JavaScript and JSON.\n3. The plan deviation in `cli.ts` is due to the fact that it was not implemented in a separate file as per the implementation plan.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Move the config structure definition to a separate file.\n2. Change the language of the schema.json file to one of the allowed languages or add TypeScript as an allowed language.\n3. Move the CLI support to a separate file.\n4. Add comments to explain the purpose of each value in the .example.env file.\n5. Add a section to the README file explaining the hierarchical config structure.\n6. Refactor the config.json file to remove redundant code.\n7. Add more comments and explanations to the schema.json file.\n8. Add more error handling and edge cases to the cli.ts file.\n\n**Severity levels:**\n\n* SEVERE: Plan deviations, language drift\n* HIGH: Conflicts between environment variables and file-based config\n* MEDIUM: Redundant code in `config.json`\n* LOW: Suggestions for improvement in `schema.json` and `cli.ts`\n\n**Status:** fail due to multiple severe findings",
