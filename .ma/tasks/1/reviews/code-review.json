However, there is a medium-level issue with the documentation update, which may not be comprehensive or up-to-date.\n\nTo address this issue, it's recommended to regularly review and update the documentation to ensure it accurately reflects the current implementation. This can be achieved by:\n\n1. Scheduling regular documentation reviews.\n2. Establishing a clear process for updating documentation.\n3. Encouraging team members to contribute to documentation updates.\n\nBy addressing this medium-level issue, the codebase will become more maintainable and easier to understand for future developers.\n\n**Additional Recommendations:**\n\n1. Consider using a documentation management tool, such as GitHub Pages or Read the Docs, to simplify documentation updates and make it easier to track changes.\n2. Develop a style guide for documentation to ensure consistency in formatting, tone, and language.\n3. Regularly review and update the README file to reflect changes in the implementation.\n\n**Plan Iteration 2 Alignment:**\n\nThe code review found that the implementation aligns with the approved plan and original task requirements. There are no deviations from the approved plan or task goals, which is a significant achievement.\n\nHowever, it's essential to continue monitoring the implementation and addressing any issues that may arise during future iterations. By doing so, you can ensure that the codebase remains maintainable, efficient, and aligned with the project's goals.",
