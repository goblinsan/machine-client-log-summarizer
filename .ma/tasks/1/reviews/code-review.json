It's responsible for both loading and validating the config.\n3. **Code smell**: The .example.env file contains default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint. These should be configurable.\n4. **Code smell**: The README file could include more information about the hierarchical config and CLI support.\n\n**SEVERE findings**\n\n* Plan deviation: The config structure is not defined in a separate JSON file as per the plan.\n* Plan deviation: The JSON schema is not defined in a separate file as per the plan.\n\nThese findings are marked as SEVERE because they deviate from the approved plan.",
