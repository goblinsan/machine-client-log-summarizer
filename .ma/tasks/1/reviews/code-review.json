The implementation plan is well-structured, but it lacks specific details on the JSON schema validation for the config structure in Step 1.\n2. In Step 3, the CLI support for loading and validating the config is not clearly defined. It's recommended to provide more information on how the CLI will handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n3. The documentation update in Step 4 does not explicitly mention how to handle conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n4. There are no severe findings, but there are some medium-level issues that need attention.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Implement JSON schema validation for the config structure as per Step 1 of the implementation plan.\n2. Document default values in .example.env file and include it in the repository as a template for users to customize their config.\n3. Update documentation to include information about handling conflicts between environment variables and file-based config.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift issues were found, as the implementation plan does not specify any allowed languages. However, if you're using a specific programming language or framework, ensure that it aligns with the project's requirements and approved plan.",
