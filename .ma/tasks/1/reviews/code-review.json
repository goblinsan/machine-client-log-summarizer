The code structure is generally well-organized, but it could benefit from more separation of concerns.\n2. The `config.json` and `.env.example` files are not clearly defined in the code. It would be beneficial to create a separate file for the config structure and import it into the main config file.\n3. The JSON schema validation is not implemented correctly. Use a library like `ajv` to validate the JSON schema against the config.\n4. The default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint are hardcoded in `.env.example`. It would be better to use environment variables or a configuration file.\n5. The README file does not include information about the hierarchical config. Add a section to the README file explaining the hierarchical config.\n\n**Plan Iteration 2 Alignment:**\n\nThe code review found some deviations from the approved plan:\n\n1. The `config_structure.json` file is not created as planned in Step 1.\n2. The JSON schema validation is not implemented correctly, which deviates from the acceptance criteria of Step 2.\n3. The README file does not include information about the hierarchical config, which deviates from the acceptance criteria of Step 4.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift was found in this code review. All files are written in TypeScript, which is allowed according to the task description.",
