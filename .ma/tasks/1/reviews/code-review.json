This is a SEVERE finding as it deviates from the approved plan.\n2. **Implementation Details Missing:** No implementation details were provided for Step 1: Define the structure of the hierarchical config. This is a MEDIUM finding, but it's essential to provide detailed implementation plans for all steps in the iteration.\n3. **.example.env File Implementation:** The .example.env file should be included in the repository as a template for users to customize their config, but no details were provided on how this will be implemented. This is a MEDIUM finding, and it's essential to provide a detailed implementation plan for including the .example.env file.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Implement CLI support for loading and validating the config as per the plan.\n2. Provide a detailed implementation plan for defining the config structure, including code snippets.\n3. Provide a detailed implementation plan for including the .example.env file in the repository.\n\n**Language Drift:** The provided code does not contain any modified files, so there are no language drift issues to report.",
