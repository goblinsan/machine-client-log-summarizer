The config structure was not defined in a JSON file as per Step 1 of the implementation plan.\n2. JSON schema validation was not implemented for the config as per Step 2 of the implementation plan.\n3. CLI support for loading and validating the config was not implemented as per Step 3 of the implementation plan.\n4. Documentation update to include information about hierarchical config and CLI support was not completed as per Step 4 of the implementation plan.\n\nAdditionally, there were some medium-level issues found:\n\n1. Language drift: The file uses TypeScript, but the primary language is not specified in the plan.\n2. Code smell: The .example.env file contains default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint. Consider using environment variables instead of hardcoding these values.\n\nNo high or low-level issues were found.",
