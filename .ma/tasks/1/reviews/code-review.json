Review the JSON schema definition to ensure it accurately represents the desired config structure.\n2. Clarify the purpose of the defaults in the .example.env file or provide more context about their usage.\n3. Review the README file to ensure it accurately reflects the changes implemented.\n\n**Language Drift:** No unauthorized language drift detected.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment:** The implementation plan aligns with the original task requirements, but some minor deviations were noted (MEDIUM findings).",
