Hardcoded credentials in `.env.example` file, which can lead to data exposure.\n2. Insecure dependencies due to an outdated JSON schema validation library in `config.json`, which can introduce security risks.\n\nAdditionally, one MEDIUM finding was identified:\n\n1. Missing headers in the JSON schema of `config.json`, which is a security concern that should be addressed.\n\nThe review did not find any HIGH or LOW findings.",
