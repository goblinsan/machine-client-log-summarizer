This could be improved by breaking it down into smaller functions for better maintainability.\n\n3. **Compile/syntax issues**: None found.\n\n4. **Organization problems**: The code structure is generally good, but there are some suggestions for improvement.\n\n5. **Lint violations**: None found.\n\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment**: The implementation matches the approved plan from `plan_artifact`.\n\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: No unauthorized language drift was detected in the modified files.\n\n**SEVERE findings:**\n\n* None\n\n**HIGH findings:**\n\n* None\n\n**MEDIUM findings:**\n\n* The main function is too long and complex.\n* Variable names could be more descriptive.\n* Unused comments are present in the .env file.\n\n**LOW findings:**\n\n* Remove unused comments from the .env file.",
