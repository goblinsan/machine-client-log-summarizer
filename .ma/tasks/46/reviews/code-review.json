These can be used as a starting point for development or testing.\n\n**Code Review**\n\n*   **Code Best Practices**: The code follows the single responsibility principle by separating configuration settings into different categories (log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint).\n*   **Maintainability Issues**: There are no large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines). The code is concise and easy to read.\n*   **Compile/Syntax Issues**: There are no syntax errors in the provided code.\n*   **Organization Problems**: The file structure is clear, and the naming conventions follow standard practices (e.g., `.example.env`).\n*   **Lint Violations**: No lint violations were detected in the provided code.\n*   **Plan and Task Goal Alignment**: The implementation matches the approved plan and original task requirements. There are no deviations from the approved plan or task goals.\n*   **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: Since this is a configuration file, there is no language drift to check for.\n\nOverall, the code review indicates that the provided `.example.env` file meets all the specified criteria and does not contain any severe or high-level issues.",
