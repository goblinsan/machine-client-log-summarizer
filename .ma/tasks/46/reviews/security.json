Here's an example:\n\n```bash\n# .example.env\n\n# Log paths\nLOG_PATH=/var/log/app.log\nERROR_LOG_PATH=/var/log/error.log\n\n# Store (database) configuration\nSTORE_HOST=localhost\nSTORE_PORT=5432\nSTORE_DB=mydb\nSTORE_USER=myuser\nSTORE_PASSWORD=mypassword\n\n# LM Studio endpoint\nLM_STUDIO_ENDPOINT=https://lm-studio.example.com/api/v1\n```\n\nIn this example, we've created a .example.env file with default values for log paths, store (database) configuration, and the LM Studio endpoint. This file is not meant to be committed to version control and should be used as a template for local development environments.\n\nHowever, if we were to simulate a security review, here's an example of what it might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \".example.env file creation successful.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [\n      {\"category\": \"Secrets scanning\", \"file\": \".example.env\", \"line\": null, \"vulnerability\": \"Hardcoded database credentials\", \"impact\": \"Potential data exposure\", \"mitigation\": \"Use environment variables or a secrets manager\"}\n    ],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we've identified a potential security concern related to hardcoded database credentials. This is considered a high-severity finding because it could potentially lead to data exposure.",
