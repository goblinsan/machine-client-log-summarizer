# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 3

Generated: 2025-11-21T15:09:08.900Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

I need to evaluate a plan for creating a .example.env file, but I don't see any implementation plan provided in your message. You've only included the task description about creating a .example.env file for code review purposes.

To properly evaluate whether the plan is concrete, actionable, and appropriate, I would need to see:

1. The actual implementation plan with specific steps
2. Files to be modified or created
3. Acceptance criteria
4. Technology alignment details

Since no plan was provided for evaluation, I cannot determine if it meets the requirements.

However, based on the task description alone, creating a .example.env file is a straightforward task that would typically involve:
- Creating a new file named .example.env
- Adding default environment variable values
- Including documentation on usage
- Following the project's existing file structure and conventions

{ "status": "fail", "reason": "No implementation plan provided for evaluation. The task description was provided but not the actual plan to be evaluated for concreteness, actionability, and appropriateness." }
