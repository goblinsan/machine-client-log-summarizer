# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 4

Generated: 2025-11-21T15:09:20.572Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

I need to evaluate a plan for creating a .example.env file, but I don't see any implementation plan provided in your message. You've only included the task description about creating a .example.env file for code review purposes.

To properly evaluate if the proposed implementation plan is concrete, actionable, and appropriate, I would need to see:

1. The actual implementation plan with specific steps
2. Files to be modified or created
3. Acceptance criteria
4. Technology stack details

Since no plan was provided for evaluation, I cannot determine if it meets the requirements.

However, based on the task description alone, this appears to be a straightforward file creation task that would typically involve:
- Creating a .example.env file
- Adding default environment variable values
- Including documentation on usage

If you have an implementation plan you'd like me to evaluate, please provide it and I'll assess whether it's concrete, actionable, and appropriate with proper file identification and acceptance criteria.

{ "status": "fail", "reason": "No implementation plan provided for evaluation" }
