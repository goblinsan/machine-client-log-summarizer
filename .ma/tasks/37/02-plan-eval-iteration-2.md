# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 2

Generated: 2025-11-21T15:08:57.459Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

I need to evaluate a plan for creating a .example.env file, but I don't see any implementation plan provided in your message. You've only given me the task description about creating a .example.env file for code review purposes.

To properly evaluate if the proposed implementation plan is concrete, actionable, and appropriate, I would need to see:

1. The actual implementation plan with specific steps
2. Files to be modified or created
3. Acceptance criteria
4. Technology stack information

Since no plan was provided for evaluation, I cannot determine if it meets the requirements.

However, I can provide guidance on what would constitute an acceptable plan for this task:

A concrete implementation plan should include:
- Clear steps like "Create .example.env file" and "Add default environment variables"
- Specific files to modify (the .example.env file itself)
- Realistic acceptance criteria (file exists, contains proper format, has documentation)
- Proper language alignment (should be a simple text/ENV file)

{ "status": "fail", "reason": "No implementation plan provided for evaluation. Please provide the specific implementation plan to be evaluated." }
