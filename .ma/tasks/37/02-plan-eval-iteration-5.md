# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 5

Generated: 2025-11-21T15:09:31.621Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

I need to evaluate a plan for creating a .example.env file, but I don't see any implementation plan provided in your message. You've only included the task description about creating a .example.env file for code review purposes.

To properly evaluate whether the plan is concrete, actionable, and appropriate, I would need to see:

1. The actual implementation plan with specific steps
2. Files to be modified or created
3. Acceptance criteria
4. Technology alignment details

Since no plan was provided for evaluation, I cannot determine if it meets the requirements.

However, based on the task description alone, this appears to be a straightforward documentation/task creation request that would typically involve:
- Creating a .example.env file
- Adding default values and documentation
- Following existing project conventions

{ "status": "fail", "reason": "No implementation plan provided for evaluation. The task description does not contain a concrete implementation plan with specific steps, files to modify, or acceptance criteria that can be validated." }
