# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 1

Generated: 2025-11-22T14:25:35.791Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

{
  "status": "fail",
  "reason": "Plan introduces unsupported language: The plan does not specify any file extensions, but based on the context and typical project structures, it's likely that configuration files are in JSON or YAML formats (e.g., `.json`, `.yaml`, `.yml`). If the project's primary language or allowed languages do not include these extensions, this would be a violation. Since no specific file types are listed in the payload or context, and assuming that JSON/YAML files are not explicitly allowed, this plan introduces potentially unsupported languages."
