## Evaluation Details

{
  "status": "fail",

Additionally, the plan does not align with any known language constraints from context_primary_language, context_insights.secondaryLanguages, or payload.allowed_languages, but it fails to provide specific, implementable steps that would allow validation of the configuration changes."
