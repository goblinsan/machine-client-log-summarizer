The code itself is not provided, but based on the description, it seems like a simple task that should not introduce any severe or high-level issues.\n\nHowever, if we were to write some sample code for this task, here's an example of what it might look like:\n\n```bash\n# Create .example.env file with default values\n\necho \"DB_HOST=localhost\" > .example.env\necho \"DB_USER=default_user\" >> .example.env\necho \"DB_PASSWORD=default_password\" >> .example.env\necho \"DB_NAME=default_database\" >> .example.env\n```\n\nThis code creates a new file called `.example.env` and populates it with some default environment variable values. This is a simple task that should not introduce any severe or high-level issues.\n\nIf we were to review this code, the findings would still be empty because there are no obvious issues with the plan or implementation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed successfully.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBut if we were to modify this code to use a language that is not allowed (e.g., Python instead of Bash), the findings would include a SEVERE issue:\n\n```python\n# Create .example.env file with default values\n\nimport os\n\nos.environ[\"DB_HOST\"] = \"localhost\"\nos.environ[\"DB_USER\"] = \"default_user\"\nos.environ[\"DB_PASSWORD\"] = \"default_password\"\nos.environ[\"DB_NAME\"] = \"default_database\"\n\nwith open(\".example.env\", \"w\") as f:\n    for key, value in os.environ.items():\n        f.write(f\"{key}={value}\\n\")\n```\n\nIn this case, the findings would include a SEVERE issue because Python is not an allowed language:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"fail\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review failed due to severe issues.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [\n      {\"file\": \".example.env\", \"line\": null, \"issue\": \"Unauthorized language drift: Python used instead of Bash.\", \"recommendation\": \"Use an allowed language (e.g., Bash) or request the unauthorized language in the task description.\"}\n    ],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```",
