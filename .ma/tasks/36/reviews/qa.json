  "output": "I need to analyze this task and determine if there are any tests to run or if this is a TDD red phase.\n\nLooking at the task description, it's asking to create a `.example.env` file with default values. This appears to be a simple file creation task rather than a code implementation that would have tests.\n\nLet me check if there's any test framework or if this is a TDD scenario:\n\n1. No test framework detected (no vitest, jest, pytest, etc. found in the project structure)\n2. No test files or test configuration found\n3. This appears to be a simple file creation task, not a code implementation with tests\n\nSince there's no test framework detected and this is just a file creation task, I cannot run any tests or linters.\n\nHowever, since there's no test framework and this is not a TDD red phase (no payload indicating TDD failing test stage), I should provide a response that acknowledges the task but cannot execute tests.\n\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"test_framework\": \"no test framework found\",\n  \"message\": \"Task is to create .example.env file with default values. No test framework detected in project, so no tests can be executed. This is a simple file creation task that doesn't require test execution.\"\n}",
