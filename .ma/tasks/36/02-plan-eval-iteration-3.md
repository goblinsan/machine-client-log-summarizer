## Evaluation Details

{"output":"I need to evaluate a plan for creating a .example.env file with default values. However, I don't see any implementation plan provided in your message - you've only included the task description.\n\nCould you please provide the actual implementation plan that I should evaluate? The plan should include:\n\n1. Specific steps to create the .example.env file\n2. Files to be modified or created\n3. Clear acceptance criteria\n4. Technology alignment verification\n\nOnce you share the implementation plan, I'll evaluate whether it's concrete, actionable, and appropriate for creating an example .env file with default values, checking for proper language support and realistic requirements.\n\nPlease provide the implementation plan you'd like me to review.","duration_ms":3060}
