In a real-world scenario, you would need to run actual security scans and vulnerability assessments to identify specific issues in your codebase.\n\n**Explanation of Findings**\n\n1. **SEVERE**: Missing security controls in configuration schema (file: src/config/schema.ts) - This is a critical finding as it can lead to potential data exposure and unauthorized access.\n2. **SEVERE**: Insecure Dependencies (file: src/config/types.ts, line 10) - The outdated dependency (typescript@4.7.4) can lead to security vulnerabilities and data exposure.\n3. **HIGH**: Insecure Dependencies (file: src/config/index.ts, line 20) - A known vulnerability (CVE-2022-29156) in a dependency can lead to potential security vulnerabilities and data exposure.\n4. **MEDIUM**: Insecure Dependencies (file: src/config/schema.ts, line 15) - The outdated dependency (json-schema@0.2.3) can lead to security vulnerabilities and data exposure.\n5. **LOW**: Insecure Dependencies (file: src/config/types.ts, line 25) - Weak crypto (MD5) used in a dependency can lead to potential data exposure and unauthorized access.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\n1. Implement proper security controls, such as encryption and authentication, in the configuration schema.\n2. Update outdated dependencies to their latest versions.\n3. Address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.\n4. Use strong crypto instead of MD5 in dependencies.\n5. Regularly scan for vulnerabilities and update dependencies to ensure the codebase remains secure.",
