Upgrade to Express.js version 4.18.1 or later to fix the Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2022-32250) in `node_modules/express/lib/application.js`.\n2. Upgrade to Body-Parser version 1.20.0 or later to fix the Denial of Service Vulnerability (CVE-2022-32251) in `node_modules/body-parser/lib/types.js`.\n3. Add a Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header to your application to prevent Cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.\n4. Add an X-Frame-Options header to your application to prevent Clickjacking and frame injection attacks.\n\nPlease note that this is not an exhaustive list of findings, and you should perform a thorough security review of your application's dependencies and configuration to identify any other potential vulnerabilities or security risks.",
