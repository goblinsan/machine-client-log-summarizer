The plan deviates from secure default values for the configuration schema, which could lead to potential data exposure and unauthorized access.\n2. The type definitions are missing type safety checks for configuration properties, which could result in potential data corruption and unauthorized access.\n\nAdditionally, one HIGH finding was identified:\n\n1. There is a potential dependency injection vulnerability due to missing validation in the configuration loading logic, which could lead to potential data exposure and unauthorized access.\n\nNo MEDIUM or LOW findings were identified during this security review.",
