If the allowed languages set is not empty, the unauthorized language drift finding will be different.\n\n**Plan Deviation**\n\nThe plan iteration 3 does not specify any specific default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint. However, the review found that these values are defined in `src/config/schema.ts`. This deviation from the approved plan may require additional discussion or clarification.\n\n**Task Goal Misalignment**\n\nThe task goal is to add default values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in configuration schema. However, the review found that these values are not properly applied in configuration loading (see MEDIUM finding). This misalignment with the task goal may require additional work or discussion.",
