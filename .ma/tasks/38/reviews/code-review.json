However, the plan does not specify any specific maintainability requirements.\n3. **Compile/Syntax Issues**: The code review did not find any compile/syntax issues.\n4. **Organization Problems**: The file structure and naming conventions seem to be clear and organized.\n5. **Lint Violations**: There are no lint violations reported in this review.\n6. **Plan and Task Goal Alignment**: The code deviates from the approved plan in several areas, including:\n\t* The acceptance criteria for updating configuration type definitions is not met.\n\t* The allowed languages in the payload do not include TypeScript, which is used in the code.\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: The modified files use TypeScript, but the allowed languages are not specified in the payload. However, based on the context, it seems that TypeScript is the primary language.\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. Review and adjust the allowed languages in the payload to include TypeScript or specify a different primary language.\n2. Update the code to meet the acceptance criteria specified in the plan for updating configuration type definitions.\n3. Review and update the code to ensure that it follows the approved plan and task requirements.",
