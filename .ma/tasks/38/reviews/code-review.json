However, the plan iteration does not specify any specific maintainability goals or requirements.\n3. **Compile/syntax issues**: The review did not find any compile or syntax errors in the provided code.\n4. **Organization problems**: The file structure and naming conventions seem to be clear and consistent with the project's standards.\n5. **Lint violations**: There are no linting issues reported, but this might depend on the specific linter used.\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment**: The review found that the implementation deviates from the approved plan in terms of language usage. The plan iteration specifies TypeScript as the primary language, but the code uses a different language (not specified in the provided plan artifact). This is considered a SEVERE finding.\n\nTo resolve this issue, replace the unauthorized language with an allowed one or update the plan to reflect the actual language used in the implementation.\n\nNote: Since the review found a SEVERE issue, the overall status is set to \"fail\".",
