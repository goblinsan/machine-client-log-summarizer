  "output": "Based on the provided plan and task requirements, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. \n\n### Code Review Results\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed with no severe findings.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"Configuration schema file is not following single responsibility principle. It's handling multiple tasks such as defining default values and configuration validation.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Consider breaking down the configuration schema into smaller files, each responsible for a specific task.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/types.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"Type definitions file is not following DRY principle. It's duplicating type definitions from other files.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Consider removing duplicate type definitions and importing them from the original source.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"low\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/index.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"Configuration loading logic could be improved for better readability and maintainability.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Consider breaking down the configuration loading logic into smaller functions, each responsible for a specific task.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Language Drift\n\nBased on the provided plan, I did not find any language drift issues. The modified files are using TypeScript, which is within the allowed set of languages.\n\n### Plan and Task Goal Alignment\n\nThe code review results do not indicate any deviations from the approved plan or task goals. However, it's essential to note that the plan does not explicitly mention the use of single responsibility principle, DRY principle, or type definitions duplication. Therefore, these findings are considered medium-level issues rather than severe ones.\n\n### Code Organization and Structure\n\nThe code organization and structure seem to be generally good. The files are well-named, and the directory structure is clear. However, as mentioned earlier, some files could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused files.\n\n### Lint Violations\n\nI did not find any lint violations during this review. However, it's essential to note that a thorough linting process should be performed regularly to catch any potential issues.\n\n### Maintainability Issues\n\nThe codebase seems to be generally maintainable. However, some methods and functions could benefit from being broken down into smaller, more focused pieces for better readability and maintainability.\n\n### Compile/Syntax Issues\n\nI did not find any compile or syntax issues during this review.\n\n### CRITICAL: Plan and Task Goal Alignment\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the code review results do not indicate any deviations from the approved plan or task goals. However, it's essential to note that the plan does not explicitly mention some of the findings mentioned above.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nBased on the findings, I recommend:\n\n1. Breaking down the configuration schema into smaller files, each responsible for a specific task.\n2. Removing duplicate type definitions and importing them from the original source.\n3. Improving the configuration loading logic for better readability and maintainability by breaking it down into smaller functions.\n\nThese recommendations should help improve the codebase's maintainability, readability, and overall quality.",
