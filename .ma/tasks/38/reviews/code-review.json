  "output": "Based on the provided plan and task requirements, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. \n\n**Code Review**\n\n### Code Best Practices\n\n1. **Single Responsibility**: The code is organized into separate files for each goal, which adheres to the single responsibility principle.\n2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: There are no repeated code blocks that can be extracted and reused.\n3. **Avoiding Repeated Code**: No repeated code was found.\n\n### Maintainability Issues\n\n1. **Large Files (>500 lines)**: The `src/config/schema.ts` file has a large number of lines, which may make it difficult to maintain. Consider breaking it down into smaller files or using a more modular approach.\n2. **Long Methods (>100 lines)**: No long methods were found.\n\n### Compile/Syntax Issues\n\n1. **Compile Errors**: No compile errors were encountered during the review.\n\n### Organization Problems\n\n1. **Poor File Structure**: The file structure is well-organized, with each goal having its own separate files.\n2. **Unclear Naming**: The file and variable names are clear and descriptive.\n\n### Lint Violations\n\nNo lint violations were found.\n\n### Plan and Task Goal Alignment\n\nThe implementation matches the approved plan from `plan_artifact` and original task requirements.\n\n### LANGUAGE DRIFT\n\nThe code uses TypeScript, which is part of the allowed languages. No unauthorized language drift was detected.\n\n**Findings**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed successfully.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"Large file with many lines, may be difficult to maintain.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Consider breaking down into smaller files or using a more modular approach.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: The only finding is related to the large size of the `src/config/schema.ts` file, which is marked as HIGH.",
