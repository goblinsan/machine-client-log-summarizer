However, the plan iteration has multiple goals and dependencies, which may indicate a need for further refactoring.\n\n3. **Compile/syntax issues**: The provided plan artifact does not contain any information about compile errors or syntax issues.\n\n4. **Organization problems**: The file structure is not explicitly mentioned in the plan artifact, but it appears to be organized by feature (e.g., `src/config/schema.ts`).\n\n5. **Lint violations**: There are no lint violations mentioned in the provided plan artifact.\n\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment**: The implementation matches the approved plan from the plan artifact for goals 1-3. However, goal 4 (\"Verify that default values are properly applied in configuration loading\") does not specify which files should be reviewed to verify this goal.\n\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: The modified file `src/config/schema.ts` uses TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages (assuming the allowed languages are specified elsewhere). This is a SEVERE finding because it deviates from the approved plan and task goals.\n\nNote: To provide more accurate results, you would need to know the allowed languages for this project.",
