It should be refactored for better maintainability by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n*   Some functions in the configuration schema file are too long (over 100 lines) and should be split into smaller functions for better maintainability.\n*   Some type definitions in the types file are not properly documented. Comments should be added to explain their purpose and usage.\n\nThese findings are considered medium-level issues, as they do not block the code from compiling or running but can still impact maintainability and readability.\n\n**Language Drift:**\n\nNo language drift was detected in the modified files. The task description does not explicitly request any specific languages, so no severe findings were reported due to unauthorized language use.\n\n**Plan Iteration 3 Alignment:**\n\nThe implementation matches the approved plan from Plan Iteration 3. No deviations from the approved plan or task goals were found, and all acceptance criteria are met.",
