  "output": "Based on the provided plan and code review guidelines, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. However, since no code is provided, I'll focus on the plan and task goals.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\nThe plan consists of four iterations with specific goals, key files, owners, dependencies, and acceptance criteria. Upon reviewing the plan, I did not find any severe deviations from approved plans or original task requirements.\n\nHowever, to ensure alignment, I recommend verifying that all code changes match the specified goals and acceptance criteria for each iteration.\n\n**Language Drift**\n\nSince no code is provided, I cannot compare modified files against the allowed languages. However, if you provide the code, I can assist in identifying any language drift issues.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBased on the plan review, I did not find any severe findings or significant problems (HIGH). The plan appears well-structured with clear goals and acceptance criteria for each iteration.\n\nHowever, to ensure a comprehensive review, please provide the code for further analysis. If you'd like me to simulate a code review based on hypothetical code changes, please let me know.\n\nHere's an example of what the JSON response might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Plan and task goals aligned with no severe findings or significant problems.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide the code for a more detailed review.",
