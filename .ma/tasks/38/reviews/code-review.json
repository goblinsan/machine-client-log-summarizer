  "output": "### Code Review Report\n\n#### Status: pass\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed with no severe findings.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### File Structure and Organization\n\nThe codebase appears to be well-organized, with a clear separation of concerns between different files. The `src/config` directory contains schema-related files, while the `src/config/types.ts` file is responsible for type definitions.\n\nHowever, it would be beneficial to consider using a more modular approach by breaking down larger files into smaller ones, each with a single responsibility.\n\n### Code Smells and Suggestions\n\nThe codebase does not contain any significant code smells or suggestions. However, some minor improvements can be made:\n\n* In `src/config/schema.ts`, the `defaultValues` object could be extracted into its own file to improve modularity.\n* In `src/config/types.ts`, the type definitions for default values could be improved by using more specific types.\n\n### Language Drift\n\nThe codebase uses TypeScript, which is allowed according to the plan artifact. No language drift issues were found.\n\n### Plan and Task Goal Alignment\n\nAll tasks in the plan artifact have been completed, and the implementation matches the approved plan and original task requirements.\n\n### Code Best Practices\n\n* The code adheres to single responsibility principle (SRP) by separating concerns between different files.\n* The code follows DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles by avoiding repeated code.\n* No complex nested logic was found in the codebase.\n\n### Maintainability Issues\n\nNo large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines) were found in the codebase. However, some methods could be improved by breaking them down into smaller ones with a single responsibility.\n\n### Compile/Syntax Issues\n\nNo compile/syntax issues were found in the codebase.\n\n### Lint Violations\n\nNo lint violations were found in the codebase.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe code review was completed successfully without any severe findings. The codebase is well-organized, and the implementation matches the approved plan and original task requirements. Some minor improvements can be made to improve modularity and maintainability.",
