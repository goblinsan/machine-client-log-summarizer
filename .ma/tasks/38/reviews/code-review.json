Unauthorized language drift in `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`, which use TypeScript but are not allowed languages.\n2. Plan deviation in `src/config/index.ts`, where the goal does not match the approved plan.\n\nAdditionally, there are high-level findings, such as complex nested logic and long methods in `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`.\n\nMedium-level findings include repeated code and inconsistent naming conventions in `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`.\n\nFinally, low-level findings include minor violations and code smells in `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`.",
