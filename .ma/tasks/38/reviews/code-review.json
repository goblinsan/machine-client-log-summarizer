Unauthorized language drift: Both `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts` are using TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages list.\n2. Plan deviation: The plan does not mention updating the configuration type definitions to include default values.\n\nAdditionally, there are some high-level issues:\n\n1. Large file (>500 lines): `src/config/index.ts` has 512 lines and should be split into smaller files for better maintainability.\n2. Complex nested logic: The configuration schema validation logic in `src/config/schema.ts` is complex and hard to read.\n\nThere are also some medium-level issues:\n\n1. Unused import: There is an unused import in `src/config/types.ts`.\n\nFinally, there are some low-level suggestions:\n\n1. Remove the unused import or use it somewhere in the code.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo fix these issues, you should:\n\n1. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add TypeScript to the allowed languages list.\n2. Update the configuration type definitions to include default values as per the plan.\n3. Split large files into smaller ones for better maintainability.\n4. Simplify complex nested logic by breaking it down into smaller functions or using a more readable syntax.\n5. Remove unused imports or use them somewhere in the code.\n\n**Plan Deviation**\n\nThe review found that the plan does not mention updating the configuration type definitions to include default values. This is a severe issue and should be addressed immediately.\n\n**Unauthorized Language Drift**\n\nThe review found that both `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts` are using TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages list. This is a severe issue and should be addressed immediately.",
