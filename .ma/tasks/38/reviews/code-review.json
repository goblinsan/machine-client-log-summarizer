This is a high-priority issue that should be addressed.\n3. **Compile/syntax issues**: No syntax errors were found during the review.\n4. **Organization problems**: The code organization is generally good, but there are some minor issues related to variable naming conventions and documentation.\n5. **Lint violations**: Several linting issues were identified, including unused variables and inconsistent naming conventions.\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment**: The implementation deviates from the approved plan in several areas, including the use of TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages set.\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: Two files (`src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`) use TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages set.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add TypeScript to the allowed languages set.\n2. Break down the `loadConfiguration` method into smaller, more manageable functions.\n3. Use a consistent naming convention for variables and consider extracting them into separate functions.\n4. Add comments to explain the purpose of each type definition in `src/config/types.ts`.\n5. Remove unused variables or consider extracting them into separate functions.\n\n**SEVERE findings:**\n\n1. Unauthorized language drift: TypeScript is not in the allowed languages set (two files).\n2. Plan deviation: Implementation deviates from the approved plan in several areas, including the use of TypeScript.\n\n**HIGH findings:**\n\n1. Method 'loadConfiguration' is too long (123 lines) and complex.\n2. Type definitions are not properly documented.\n\n**MEDIUM findings:**\n\n1. Variable 'defaultValues' is not used consistently throughout the file.\n2. Type definitions are not properly documented.\n\n**LOW findings:**\n\n1. Variable 'schema' is assigned but not used.\n2. Function 'getTypeDefinitions' is too long (50 lines).",
