However, there are some suggestions and recommendations for improvement.\n\n### Plan Alignment\n\nThe plan is well-structured, and all goals, key files, owners, dependencies, and acceptance criteria are clearly defined. The risks, open questions, and notes sections provide valuable context and insights into potential challenges and areas of concern.\n\n### Task Goal Misalignment\n\nThere are no apparent deviations from the approved plan or task goals in this iteration.\n\n### Language Drift\n\nNo language drift issues were found, as no code was provided for review.\n\n**Summary**\n\nBased on the provided plan, I conclude that:\n\n* Status: pass\n* Summary: The plan is well-structured and aligns with the approved plan. No severe issues or deviations from the task goals were found.\n* Findings:\n\t+ Severe: []\n\t+ High: []\n\t+ Medium: []\n\t+ Low: []\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"The plan is well-structured and aligns with the approved plan.
