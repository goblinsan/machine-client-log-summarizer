Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add TypeScript to the allowed languages set in the plan.\n2. Break down the `loadConfiguration` method into smaller, more manageable functions.\n3. Use a consistent formatting style for the 'defaultValues' object.\n4. Consider breaking down the `ConfigurationType` interface into smaller, more manageable interfaces.\n5. Add comments to explain the purpose and structure of the `schema` object.\n6. Remove unused properties from the `ConfigurationType` interface.\n\n**SEVERE findings:**\n\n1. Unauthorized language drift in `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`.\n2. Plan deviations in several areas, including the use of TypeScript.\n\n**HIGH findings:**\n\n1. Method 'loadConfiguration' is too long (120 lines) and complex in `src/config/index.ts`.\n\n**MEDIUM findings:**\n\n1. The 'defaultValues' object is not properly formatted in `src/config/schema.ts`.\n2. The 'ConfigurationType' interface has too many properties (10) in `src/config/types.ts`.\n\n**LOW findings:**\n\n1. The 'schema' object is not properly commented in `src/config/schema.ts`.\n2. The 'ConfigurationType' interface has some unused properties in `src/config/types.ts`.",
