This is a severe issue because it means that the code does not meet the requirements of the task.\n*   **Complex nested logic**: The configuration loading logic in `src/config/index.ts` is complex and may be difficult to maintain. This is a high-priority issue because it can make the code harder to understand and debug.\n*   **Code smell: Large file**: `src/config/schema.ts` is too large and may be difficult to maintain. This is a medium-priority issue because it can make the code harder to understand and modify.\n*   **Code smell: Poor documentation**: The type definitions in `src/config/types.ts` are not properly documented. This is a medium-priority issue because it can make the code harder to understand and maintain.\n*   **Suggestion: Improve error handling**: The configuration loading logic in `src/config/index.ts` could be improved by adding more error handling. This is a low-priority suggestion because it is not critical, but it can still improve the robustness of the code.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo fix these issues, you should:\n\n*   Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add it to the list of allowed languages in `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`.\n*   Simplify the configuration loading logic in `src/config/index.ts` by breaking it down into smaller functions or using a more modular approach.\n*   Break down the schema file in `src/config/schema.ts` into smaller files or use a more modular approach.\n*   Add proper documentation to the type definitions in `src/config/types.ts`.\n*   Add more error handling to the configuration loading logic in `src/config/index.ts`.",
