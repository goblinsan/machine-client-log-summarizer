  "output": "Based on the provided plan and code review guidelines, I will conduct a comprehensive review of the code. However, since no code is provided, I'll assume that we're reviewing an existing project with multiple files.\n\n**Code Best Practices**\n\n1. Single Responsibility: The code should follow the single responsibility principle (SRP), where each file or module has only one reason to change.\n2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): The code should avoid repeating itself, and instead use abstractions or functions to reduce duplication.\n3. Avoid Repeated Code: The code should minimize repeated code blocks.\n\n**Maintainability Issues**\n\n1. Large Files (>500 lines): Check if any files exceed the 500-line limit.\n2. Long Methods (>100 lines): Check if any methods exceed the 100-line limit.\n3. Complex Nested Logic: Review complex nested logic and suggest simplifications.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues**\n\n1. Syntax Errors: Ensure that there are no syntax errors in the code.\n2. Type Errors: Verify that type annotations match the actual types used in the code.\n\n**Organization Problems**\n\n1. Poor File Structure: Check if files are organized logically, with related functions and variables grouped together.\n2. Unclear Naming: Review variable and function names to ensure they're descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.\n\n**Lint Violations**\n\n1. Lint Errors: Run linters on the code to identify any linting errors or warnings.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\n1. Validate Implementation Matches Approved Plan: Compare the implementation with the approved plan from `plan_artifact` (if provided) and original task requirements.\n2. Flag Deviations from Approved Plan or Task Goals as SEVERE Findings: Identify any deviations from the approved plan or task goals and flag them as severe findings.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT**\n\n1. Compare Changed Files Against Payload.Allowed_Languages: Check if modified files use languages outside the allowed set specified in `payload.allowed_languages` (or the union of `context_primary_language` and `context_secondary_languages`).\n2. Return Status=\"fail\" with SEVERE Finding for Unauthorized Language Drift: If any modified files use unauthorized languages, return a status of \"fail\" with severe findings naming each offending file and language.\n\nHere's an example JSON response:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed successfully.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIf there are any severe findings, the status will be set to \"fail\":\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"fail\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review failed due to severe issues.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [\n      {\"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\", \"line\": 10, \"issue\": \"Unauthorized language drift: TypeScript used instead of JavaScript.\", \"recommendation\": \"Replace TypeScript with JavaScript.\"}\n    ],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide the code for further review.",
