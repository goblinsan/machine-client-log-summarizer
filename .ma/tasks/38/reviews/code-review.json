This is a severe issue that requires immediate attention.\n2. **Large file**: `src/config/index.ts` has 512 lines, exceeding the recommended limit of 500 lines per file. This is a high-priority issue that should be addressed to improve maintainability.\n3. **Complex nested logic**: The configuration schema file (`src/config/schema.ts`) contains complex nested logic that may be difficult to understand. This is a medium-priority issue that can be improved by simplifying the logic.\n4. **Unused variable**: `src/config/types.ts` contains an unused variable, which should be removed to improve code quality.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo address these issues, consider the following:\n\n1. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add it to the allowed languages list.\n2. Split large files into smaller ones to improve maintainability.\n3. Simplify complex nested logic by breaking it down into smaller functions or classes.\n4. Remove unused variables to improve code quality.\n\n**Plan Deviation**\n\nThe review also found deviations from the approved plan:\n\n1. **Goal 1**: The goal \"Identify and analyze existing configuration schema files\" was not completed, as no analysis of the current structure was performed.\n2. **Goal 3**: The goal \"Update configuration type definitions to include default values\" was not completed, as the type definitions were not updated to reflect the new default values.\n\nThese deviations are severe issues that require immediate attention and should be addressed by revisiting the plan and completing the missing tasks.",
