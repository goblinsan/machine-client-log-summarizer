Unauthorized language drift: The `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts` files use TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages set.\n2. Plan deviation: The goal \"Update configuration type definitions to include default values\" was not fully implemented in `src/config/types.ts`.\n3. Plan deviation: The goal \"Verify that default values are properly applied in configuration loading\" was not fully implemented in `src/config/index.ts`.\n\nAdditionally, the review found several high-level issues:\n\n1. Large file (>500 lines): The `src/config/schema.ts` file has 567 lines.\n2. Long method (>100 lines): The `src/config/types.ts` file has several long methods.\n\nThe review also found a medium-level issue:\n\n1. Complex nested logic: The `src/config/schema.ts` file has complex nested logic.\n\nFinally, the review found a low-level issue:\n\n1. Unused variable: There is an unused variable in the `src/config/index.ts` file.",
