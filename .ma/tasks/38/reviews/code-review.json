Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add it to the allowed languages.\n2. Simplify the validation logic by breaking it down into smaller functions or using a more robust validation library.\n3. Split the large `types.ts` file into smaller files, each with its own responsibility.\n4. Remove the unused import or use it in the code.\n\n**Plan Deviation**\n\nThe review also found that the plan deviated from the approved plan:\n\n1. The `src/config/schema.ts` file uses an unauthorized language (TypeScript).\n2. The configuration schema validation logic is complex and difficult to understand.\n\nThese deviations are flagged as severe, indicating a critical issue with the implementation.",
