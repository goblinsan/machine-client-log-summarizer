Replace TypeScript with an allowed language in `src/config/schema.ts`, `src/config/types.ts`, and `src/config/index.ts`.\n2. Re-evaluate and align goal \"Verify that default values are properly applied in configuration loading\" with the approved plan.\n3. Split large files into smaller ones for better maintainability (e.g., `src/config/schema.ts` has 567 lines).\n4. Break down long methods into smaller ones for better maintainability (e.g., `updateConfigTypeDefinitions()` in `src/config/types.ts` has 127 lines).\n5. Simplify complex nested logic in `src/config/schema.ts`.",
