These files are using TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages set.\n* Plan deviation: The plan does not specify that these files should be written in a different language.\n\n**HIGH Findings:**\n\n* Method 'updateDefaultValues' in `src/config/schema.ts` is too long (120 lines) and complex. This method should be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n* File `src/config/types.ts` has over 500 lines of code, making it difficult to maintain. This file should be split into smaller files or refactored to reduce its size.\n\n**MEDIUM Findings:**\n\n* Method 'loadConfiguration' in `src/config/index.ts` has a long name and is not following single responsibility principle. This method should be renamed to something more descriptive and considered breaking it down into smaller functions.\n\n**LOW Findings:**\n\n* Variable 'defaultValues' in `src/config/schema.ts` is not following camelCase convention. This variable should be renamed to follow the camelCase convention.",
