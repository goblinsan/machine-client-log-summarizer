These files use TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages.\n* Plan deviation: The plan does not specify the use of TypeScript.\n\n**HIGH Findings**\n\n* Complex nested logic in `src/config/schema.ts`. The configuration schema has multiple levels of nesting, making it difficult to understand and maintain.\n* Large file (>500 lines) in `src/config/types.ts`. The types file is too large and needs to be split into smaller files for better maintainability.\n\n**MEDIUM Findings**\n\n* Repeated code in `src/config/schema.ts`. The default values are repeated in multiple places, making it difficult to maintain.\n* Long method (>100 lines) in `src/config/index.ts`. The configuration loading logic is too long and needs to be split into smaller methods.\n\n**LOW Findings**\n\n* Code smell in `src/config/schema.ts`. The configuration schema has a magic number (10) that needs to be replaced with a constant.",
