However, the plan iteration has multiple goals and dependencies that might make it harder to maintain.\n\n3. **Compile/syntax issues**: No compile or syntax errors were found in the provided code.\n\n4. **Organization problems**: The file structure is not explicitly mentioned in the plan iteration, but it seems to be organized by feature (configuration schema).\n\n5. **Lint violations**: There are no lint violations mentioned in the provided code.\n\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment**: The implementation matches the approved plan from the `plan_artifact` if provided, AND original task requirements.\n\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: The modified files (`src/config/schema.ts`) use TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages (assuming it's JavaScript or a subset of it). This is a SEVERE finding because it deviates from the approved plan and task goals.\n\nNote: To fix this issue, replace TypeScript with an allowed language. If TypeScript is required for some reason, add it to the allowed languages in the `payload.allowed_languages` field.",
