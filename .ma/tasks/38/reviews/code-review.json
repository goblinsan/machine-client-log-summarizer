  "output": "Based on the provided plan and task requirements, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. \n\n### Code Review Results\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"fail\",\n  \"summary\": \"Plan deviations and language drift detected.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"Unauthorized language drift: TypeScript is not in the allowed languages set.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Replace TypeScript with an allowed language.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/types.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"Plan deviation: Goal \\\"Update configuration type definitions to include default values\\\" was not implemented as per plan.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Implement the goal as specified in the plan.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Code Best Practices**: The code review did not find any significant issues related to single responsibility, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), or avoiding repeated code.\n\n2. **Maintainability Issues**: There are no large files (>500 lines) or long methods (>100 lines). However, the plan deviation in `src/config/types.ts` may indicate a maintainability issue if not addressed.\n\n3. **Compile/Syntax Issues**: No compile/syntax issues were found during this review.\n\n4. **Organization Problems**: The file structure and naming conventions seem to be clear and well-organized.\n\n5. **Lint Violations**: This review did not check for lint violations, as it is not part of the provided task requirements.\n\n6. **Plan and Task Goal Alignment**: There are two severe findings related to plan deviations:\n   - `src/config/types.ts`: The goal \"Update configuration type definitions to include default values\" was not implemented as per the plan.\n   - `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`: Unauthorized language drift detected. TypeScript is not in the allowed languages set.\n\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: Two files (`src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`) use TypeScript, which is not in the allowed languages set. This is a severe finding as it deviates from the approved plan and task requirements.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nTo address these issues:\n\n- Implement the goal \"Update configuration type definitions to include default values\" as specified in the plan.\n- Replace TypeScript with an allowed language in `src/config/schema.ts` and `src/config/types.ts`.\n- Review and update the file structure, naming conventions, and lint rules according to best practices.",
