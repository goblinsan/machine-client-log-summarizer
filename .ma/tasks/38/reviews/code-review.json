Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add TypeScript to the allowed languages set.\n2. Break down long methods into smaller, more manageable functions.\n3. Review type definitions and update them accordingly.\n4. Improve configuration loading logic to handle default values correctly.\n5. Consider breaking down large files into smaller files or modules.\n6. Extract repeated code into a separate function or module for better maintainability.\n7. Improve type definitions for better readability.\n\n**SEVERE Findings:**\n\n1. Unauthorized language drift: TypeScript is not in the allowed languages set.\n\n**HIGH Findings:**\n\n1. Method 'addDefaultValues' is too long (120 lines) and complex.\n2. Type definitions are not properly updated to reflect default values.\n3. Configuration loading logic is not properly handling default values.\n\n**MEDIUM Findings:**\n\n1. Schema file has too many lines (520).\n2. Configuration loading logic has repeated code.\n\n**LOW Findings:**\n\n1. Type definitions can be improved for better readability.\n2. Consider using more descriptive type names and improving overall type definition structure.\n3. Extract repeated code into a separate function or module for better maintainability.",
