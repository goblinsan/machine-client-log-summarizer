Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or update the task description to explicitly request TypeScript.\n2. Complete the implementation of updating configuration type definitions to include default values and verifying that default values are properly applied in configuration loading.\n3. Split large files into smaller ones to improve maintainability.\n4. Simplify complex nested logic by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n5. Extract repeated code into a separate function to improve maintainability and reduce duplication.\n6. Rename variables to more descriptive names.\n\n**Note:** The above findings are based on the provided plan artifact and task requirements. If any deviations from the approved plan or task goals are found, they will be flagged as SEVERE findings.",
