  "output": "Based on the provided plan, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. However, since no actual code is provided, this review will be based on assumptions and hypothetical scenarios.\n\n**Code Best Practices**\n\n1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The code should follow SRP by having each function or module responsible for only one task.\n2. Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): The code should avoid duplicating logic or functionality to maintain maintainability and reduce errors.\n3. Avoid Repeated Code: The code should minimize repeated code blocks, functions, or variables.\n\n**Maintainability Issues**\n\n1. Large Files (>500 lines): The plan does not specify any file sizes, but it's essential to keep files manageable (less than 500 lines) for maintainability and readability.\n2. Long Methods (>100 lines): Similarly, methods should be kept short (less than 100 lines) to ensure they are easy to understand and modify.\n3. Complex Nested Logic: The code should avoid complex nested logic structures, which can make it difficult to read and understand.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues**\n\n1. Syntax Errors: There should be no syntax errors in the code, as this would prevent compilation.\n2. Type Errors: The code should use type annotations correctly to ensure that there are no type-related errors at compile-time.\n\n**Organization Problems**\n\n1. Poor File Structure: The plan specifies key files for each goal, but it's essential to maintain a consistent and logical file structure throughout the project.\n2. Unclear Naming: Variable and function names should be clear and descriptive to avoid confusion.\n\n**Lint Violations**\n\n1. Code Style Consistency: The code should follow a consistent coding style throughout the project (e.g., indentation, spacing, naming conventions).\n2. Error Handling: The code should handle errors properly to prevent crashes or unexpected behavior.\n\n**CRITICAL: Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\nBased on the provided plan, I did not find any deviations from approved plans or task goals. However, it's essential to ensure that all implementation matches the approved plan and original task requirements.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT**\n\nSince no actual code is provided, I cannot compare modified files against payload.allowed_languages. However, if you provide the code, I can assist with this comparison.\n\nHere's a sample JSON response for a hypothetical code review:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed successfully.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\",\n        \"line\": 23,\n        \"issue\": \"Complex nested logic structure detected.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Simplify the logic by breaking it down into smaller functions.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nPlease provide the actual code for a more detailed and accurate review.",
