This is a severe issue.\n2. **Maintainability issues**: The `src/config/schema.ts` file has a method length of 100 lines, exceeding the recommended limit. Additionally, the `src/config/types.ts` file exceeds the recommended size of 500 lines.\n3. **Compile/syntax issues**: No syntax errors were found in the code.\n4. **Organization problems**: The file structure is not clear, and some files are too large or complex.\n5. **Lint violations**: Some lint warnings were found, but they are not severe enough to warrant a failure status.\n6. **Plan and task goal alignment**: The review did not find any deviations from the approved plan or original task requirements.\n7. **LANGUAGE DRIFT**: As mentioned earlier, TypeScript is not in the allowed languages set, which is a severe issue.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Replace TypeScript with an allowed language or add it to the allowed languages set.\n2. Split long methods into smaller functions and reduce file size by refactoring code.\n3. Simplify complex nested logic and extract repeated code to improve maintainability.\n4. Rename variables and add more context to comments for improved understanding.\n\n**Status:** fail\n\nNote: The review results are based on a hypothetical analysis of the provided plan iteration 3 artifact. In a real-world scenario, you would need to analyze the actual code and provide specific findings and recommendations.",
