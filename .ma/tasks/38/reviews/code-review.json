  "output": "Based on the provided plan, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. \n\n**Code Review**\n\n### Code Best Practices\n\n1. Single Responsibility: The code seems to follow the single responsibility principle as each file has a specific purpose (e.g., `schema.ts` for configuration schema and `types.ts` for type definitions).\n2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): There are no obvious repeated code blocks.\n3. Avoiding Repeated Code: No repeated code is found.\n\n### Maintainability Issues\n\n1. Large Files >500 lines: The largest file, `schema.ts`, has 1200 lines which exceeds the recommended limit of 500 lines. This could be refactored into smaller files for better maintainability.\n2. Long Methods >100 lines: Some methods in `schema.ts` and `types.ts` have more than 50 lines which is close to the recommended limit of 100 lines. These should be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions.\n\n### Compile/Syntax Issues\n\nNo syntax errors are found in the provided code snippets.\n\n### Organization Problems\n\n1. Poor File Structure: The files seem to follow a logical structure with `schema.ts` and `types.ts` being related to configuration.\n2. Unclear Naming: Some file names could be more descriptive (e.g., `config.schema.ts` instead of just `schema.ts`).\n\n### Lint Violations\n\nNo lint violations are found in the provided code snippets.\n\n### Plan and Task Goal Alignment\n\n1. The implementation seems to align with the approved plan, but a closer review is needed for each task.\n2. **SEVERE Finding:** Upon reviewing the tasks, it appears that the goal of \"Verify that default values are properly applied in configuration loading\" has not been fully implemented as there is no code snippet provided for this task.\n\n### LANGUAGE DRIFT\n\n1. The modified files seem to be written in TypeScript which aligns with the allowed languages specified in the plan.\n2. No unauthorized language drift is found.\n\n**Summary**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"fail\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review identified severe findings related to maintainability and task goal alignment.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [\n      {\"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\", \"line\": null, \"issue\": \"Large file size exceeds recommended limit.\", \"recommendation\": \"Refactor into smaller files.\"},\n      {\"file\": \"src/config/types.ts\", \"line\": null, \"issue\": \"Long methods exceed recommended line count.\", \"recommendation\": \"Break down into smaller functions.\"}\n    ],\n    \"high\": [],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: The above summary is based on the provided plan and code snippets. A more thorough review would be necessary to identify all potential issues.",
