  "output": "Based on the provided plan and task requirements, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. \n\n**Code Review**\n\n### Code Best Practices\n\n1. **Single Responsibility**: The code seems to follow the single responsibility principle as each file has a specific purpose.\n2. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: There are no repeated code blocks found in the provided files.\n3. **Avoiding Repeated Code**: No repeated code is found.\n\n### Maintainability Issues\n\n1. **Large Files >500 lines**: The `src/config/schema.ts` file has 567 lines, which exceeds the recommended limit of 500 lines. This file should be refactored to reduce its size and improve maintainability.\n2. **Long Methods >100 lines**: No long methods are found in the provided files.\n\n### Compile/Syntax Issues\n\n1. **Compile Errors**: No compile errors are reported.\n\n### Organization Problems\n\n1. **Poor File Structure**: The file structure seems to be well-organized, with each file having a specific purpose.\n2. **Unclear Naming**: The file names and variable names seem clear and descriptive.\n\n### Lint Violations\n\nNo lint violations are reported.\n\n### Plan and Task Goal Alignment\n\nThe code implementation matches the approved plan from `plan_artifact` and original task requirements.\n\n### LANGUAGE DRIFT\n\nTo check for language drift, I will compare the changed files against the allowed languages specified in the plan. The allowed languages are not explicitly mentioned in the plan, but based on the file extensions, it appears that TypeScript is used. Therefore, I assume that TypeScript is the primary language and JavaScript is the secondary language.\n\nThe modified files are:\n\n* `src/config/schema.ts`\n* `src/config/types.ts`\n* `src/config/index.ts`\n\nThese files use only TypeScript, which matches the allowed languages. No severe findings related to language drift are reported.\n\n### Findings\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed with no severe findings.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\",\n        \"line\": null,\n        \"issue\": \"File size exceeds recommended limit of 500 lines.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Refactor the file to reduce its size and improve maintainability.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": []\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe code review completed with no severe findings. However, a high-severity finding was reported due to the large size of the `src/config/schema.ts` file. This issue should be addressed by refactoring the file to reduce its size and improve maintainability.",
