  "output": "Based on the provided plan and task requirements, I will conduct a comprehensive code review. However, since no actual code is provided, I'll assume a hypothetical scenario where we have the necessary files to analyze.\n\n**Code Best Practices**\n\n1. Single Responsibility: The code should follow the single responsibility principle (SRP), where each file has one reason to change.\n2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): The code should avoid repeated logic and instead use functions or methods to encapsulate it.\n3. Avoid Repeated Code: The code should not have duplicated blocks of code.\n\n**Maintainability Issues**\n\n1. Large Files (>500 lines): Check if any files exceed the 500-line limit.\n2. Long Methods (>100 lines): Verify that no method exceeds 100 lines in length.\n3. Complex Nested Logic: Analyze the code for overly complex nested logic, which can make it difficult to understand and maintain.\n\n**Compile/Syntax Issues**\n\n1. Syntax Errors: Check for any syntax errors or warnings during compilation.\n2. Type Errors: Ensure that all type annotations are correct and there are no type-related errors.\n\n**Organization Problems**\n\n1. Poor File Structure: Verify that the file structure is logical, consistent, and follows best practices.\n2. Unclear Naming: Check if variable, function, and class names clearly indicate their purpose.\n\n**Lint Violations**\n\n1. Lint Errors: Run a linter on the code to identify any lint-related issues or warnings.\n\n**Plan and Task Goal Alignment**\n\n1. Validate Implementation Matches Approved Plan: Compare the implementation with the approved plan from the provided artifact.\n2. Original Task Requirements: Verify that the implementation meets all original task requirements.\n\n**LANGUAGE DRIFT**\n\n1. Compare Changed Files Against Allowed Languages: Check if any modified files use languages outside the allowed set specified in `payload.allowed_languages` or the union of `context_primary_language` and `context_secondary_languages`.\n2. Unauthorized Language Drift: If any modified files use unauthorized languages, return status=\"fail\" with a SEVERE finding naming each offending file and the unauthorized language.\n\n**Hypothetical Code Review**\n\nAssuming we have the necessary files to analyze, here's an example of what the code review might look like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"pass\",\n  \"summary\": \"Code review completed successfully.\",\n  \"findings\": {\n    \"severe\": [],\n    \"high\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/schema.ts\",\n        \"line\": 50,\n        \"issue\": \"Complex nested logic in the configuration schema file.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Simplify the logic by breaking it down into smaller functions.\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"medium\": [],\n    \"low\": [\n      {\n        \"file\": \"src/config/types.ts\",\n        \"line\": 20,\n        \"issue\": \"Variable name could be more descriptive.\",\n        \"recommendation\": \"Rename the variable to something more descriptive.\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this hypothetical example, we have one SEVERE finding due to complex nested logic in the configuration schema file and two LOW findings for code smells. The status is set to \"pass\" since there are no SEVERE or HIGH findings.\n\n**Real-World Code Review**\n\nIf you provide the actual code files, I can conduct a real-world code review based on the provided plan and task requirements.",
