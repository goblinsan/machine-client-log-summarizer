# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 5

Generated: 2025-11-21T15:15:01.711Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

I need to evaluate a plan for defining default configuration values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in the configuration schema. However, I don't see any actual implementation plan provided in your message - you've only given the task description.

To properly evaluate if a plan is concrete, actionable, and appropriate, I would need to see:

1. The actual implementation plan with specific steps
2. Identified files to modify
3. Clear acceptance criteria
4. Technology alignment verification

Since no plan was provided for evaluation, I cannot determine if it meets the requirements.

However, I can provide guidance on what would constitute an acceptable plan:

A concrete and actionable plan should include:
- Specific files to modify (e.g., config schema files, configuration loader files)
- Clear steps for implementation
- Defined default values for the specified fields
- Acceptance criteria that can be validated
- Technology alignment verification

{ "status": "fail", "reason": "No implementation plan provided for evaluation. Please provide the actual implementation plan to be evaluated for concreteness, actionability, and appropriateness." }
