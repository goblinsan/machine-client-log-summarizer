# Plan Evaluation - Iteration 1

Generated: 2025-11-21T15:14:01.685Z

**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

I need to evaluate a plan for defining default configuration values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in the configuration schema. However, I don't see any actual implementation plan provided in your message - you've only given the task description.

To properly evaluate this, I would need to see:

1. A concrete implementation plan with specific steps
2. Files to be modified 
3. Acceptance criteria
4. Technology alignment verification

Since no plan was provided for evaluation, I cannot assess whether it meets the requirements of being concrete, actionable, and appropriate.

{ "status": "fail", "reason": "No implementation plan provided for evaluation. A concrete plan with specific steps, files to modify, and acceptance criteria is required to determine if it's appropriate for the task." }
