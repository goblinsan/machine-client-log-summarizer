  "output": "I need to analyze this task and run tests to verify the implementation. Let me examine what's available.\n\nBased on the task description, this appears to be about defining default configuration values for log paths, store, and LM Studio endpoint in a configuration schema. However, I don't have access to the actual project files or repository structure to run tests directly.\n\nSince I cannot detect a runnable test framework in the environment and don't have access to the project files to execute tests, I must return a failure status.\n\n```json\n{\n    \"status\": \"fail\",\n    \"root_causes\": [\n        \"No test framework detected in the environment (vitest, jest, pytest, etc.)\",\n        \"Cannot locate runnable test files or project structure to execute tests\",\n        \"Missing test infrastructure or configuration preventing test execution\"\n    ],\n    \"recommendations\": [\n        \"Install appropriate test dependencies (e.g., vitest for JavaScript/TypeScript, pytest for Python)\",\n        \"Set up test configuration files (vitest.config.js, jest.config.js, pytest.ini, etc.)\",\n        \"Create test files in standard locations (test/, __tests/, spec/ directories)\",\n        \"Ensure project has proper package.json or Cargo.toml with test scripts\"\n    ],\n    \"tdd_red_phase_detected\": false,\n    \"test_execution_details\": {\n        \"framework\": \"no test framework found\",\n        \"status\": \"fail\",\n        \"passed\": 0,\n        \"failed\": 0,\n        \"skipped\": 0\n    }\n}\n```",
