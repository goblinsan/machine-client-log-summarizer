**Status:** fail

## Evaluation Details

{
  "status": "fail",
  "reason": "Plan introduces unsupported language: The plan does not specify any files with extensions that map to languages not listed in context_primary_language, context_insights.secondaryLanguages, or payload.allowed_languages. However, the plan lacks concrete implementation details such as specific file paths and extensions to be modified, which makes it non-actionable. It also does not define clear steps for modifying configuration schema files."
