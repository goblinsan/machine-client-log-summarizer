  ],
  "risks": [
    "No existing test files or configuration files (like package.json, jest.config.js) were observed in the scan, which may complicate test implementation",
    "The project structure appears minimal with no build tooling or configuration files, which might require additional setup for testing"
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Should the fileIngest.ts module be placed in a new 'ingest' directory or within an existing structure?",
    "Are there any specific requirements for the normalized record format that should be enforced?",
    "Is there a preferred testing framework or approach that should be used for this project?"
  ],
  "notes": [
    "Based on the scan, there are no existing test files or configuration files in the repository that would support immediate unit testing",
    "The project appears to be a minimal React application with SCSS styling, but lacks build configuration and testing infrastructure",
    "The task requires implementing file ingestion functionality that supports ndjson and arrays, which will likely require parsing logic for these formats"
  ]
